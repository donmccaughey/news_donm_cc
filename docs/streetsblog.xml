</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s a new technology in San Francisco that could be key to both meeting our city’s climate change goals and stemming the scourge of traffic &#8211; and traffic violence &#8211; on our streets. Let us introduce you to the e-bike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About 800,000 e-bikes were sold nationwide in 2021, a 70% increase over the year prior, and it’s clear the momentum is only growing. San Francisco is riding this same national trend. In our hilly city by the bay, e-bikes can transform trips that used to require breaking a sweat into comfortable, everyday transport. The advent of e-bikes has come with a variety of new vehicle types, from adaptive to cargo, meaning that a new wave of riders feel more welcome to take to the streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Family e-bikes that have room for passengers and similar amenities to an SUV are available at a fraction of the cost. Adaptive e-bikes make the vehicles more accessible. Meanwhile, delivery workers switch to e-bikes for lower costs and more flexibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is great news for our city, and great news for the climate, too &#8211; over its lifecycle, an e-bike causes just a tiny fraction as much greenhouse gas emissions as a car, whether gas or electric. And their lower cost makes a new e-bike accessible to vastly more people than a new electric car. In fact, there were over 20% more electric bikes sold than electric cars in 2021, making them the most popular electric vehicle type by far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, the good news mostly ends there. E-bikes face one steep challenge: where to store them overnight? For e-bikes to fully flourish, they must be paired with widespread access to secure, insurable, easy storage near home &#8211; just like we offer for residents with cars. Without that, an e-bike </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">will </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">get stolen &#8211; it’s a matter of when, not if. If San Francisco wants residents to invest $1,000 or more in an e-bike, purchasers need to know that their new vehicle won’t disappear a week later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In our dense city, the majority of our residents live in multifamily buildings and may not have dedicated garage space. This is good for climate change and for having thriving, bikeable neighborhoods. What isn’t good is that we’ve turned over nearly 100% of our city’s curb space to the storage of private, largely fossil-fuel powered vehicles, and made it impossible for our neighbors who don’t have a garage to invest in an e-bike instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Board of Supervisors held a hearing last month to look at possible solutions. This isn’t a technology problem: There are numerous residential bicycle storage lockers available. The oldest bicycle lockers were developed a quarter century ago, and the </span><a href="https://cyclehoop.us/product/cargo-bikehangar/"><span style="font-weight: 400">latest models</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> have been redesigned to accommodate today’s larger cargo bikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Board also explored policies to actually bring these lockers to San Francisco streets. Some options were simple, bureaucratic, and privately-oriented: expanding the Shared Spaces program to include secure residential bicycle storage as an option, or creating a spinoff program based on temporary moving crate permits. Some were more creative and publicly-oriented: piloting a widespread, city-managed locker system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We should look to other cities for guidance. Portland is </span><a href="https://bikeportland.org/2022/02/08/pbot-pilot-program-adds-secure-bike-parking-for-hacienda-cdc-residents-348273"><span style="font-weight: 400">piloting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> eight bike lockers at affordable housing sites, while New York City is </span><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2022/Innovative-new-bike-parking-pilot.shtml"><span style="font-weight: 400">placing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a six-bike curbside bike locker at five separate sites over a six month pilot. Both models give us a head start to learn from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Supervisor Matt Dorsey showed leadership in calling for the hearing, and other members of the Board seemed interested in solutions. Now, it’s our role as residents and voters to make sure the city and the Board take bold action in the months ahead. As we start 2023, let’s make our intention absolutely clear: We expect concrete plans for scalable programs that can be piloted this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By </span><a href="https://www.sfmta.com/press-releases/sfmta-completes-citywide-census-street-parking-spaces"><span style="font-weight: 400">one estimate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, San Francisco has nearly 300,000 on-street parking spaces reserved for cars. That represents enough space to parallel-park a line of cars along the entirety of California’s 840-mile coast. Is it too much to ask to turn a bit of that space over to e-bikes, so that we can do our part to protect the actual California coastline?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/2023.png?w=400"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p>Here at Streetsblog, we firmly believe that we can all play a role in ending car dependency in America. But could we end it even faster if every reader of this site committed to a whole <em>year </em>of advocacy — or even just making the kind of small, intentional, daily changes that chip away at car culture over time?</p>
<p>As we open on 2023, here are some ideas for sustainable-transportation-centered resolutions that we think can make a meaningful difference in U.S. communities — inspired by you.</p>
<h2>1. Take a local leader on a bike ride</h2>
<p>Something as simple as going on a walk or roll around the neighborhood with friends can change the way you see your city forever. Doing it with a local elected or transportation reporter, though, can help people with real power see what people outside cars deal with every day, and create a moving forum for solutions.</p>
<p>Want to make it a regular thing? Check out our conversation with Equiticity&#8217;s Olatunji Oboi Reed on how <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/05/24/the-brake-podcast-how-community-mobility-rituals-can-transform-neighborhoods/">&#8220;community mobility rituals&#8221;</a> like weekly group rides and monthly walking clubs can be a powerful tool for change.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Figuring out casual <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6b2.png" alt="🚲" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />rides that look for urban nature, then step into hosting neighborhood rides, with a particular effort to include reporters &amp; electeds</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>2. Write (or tweet) a letter to the editor every time your local paper calls a crash an &#8216;accident&#8217;</h2>
<p>Studies show that news stories that describe car crashes as &#8220;accidents&#8221; or tacitly blame pedestrians for their own deaths can actually <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2019.100073">convince the public</a> that nothing can be done to save lives. This year, let&#8217;s commit to making noise every time a journalist <a href="http://crashnotaccident.com">uses the a-word,</a> whether that&#8217;s a simple Tweet or a full-on op-ed about why we need to change the narrative about traffic violence.</p>
<p>Bonus point: learn about the structural reasons why so many journalists simply regurgitate the text of police crash reports — and then give your local police a handy template to write better ones.</p>

<h2>3. Shake up the school drop-off routine</h2>
<p>People with kids don&#8217;t always have much of a choice about the daily school run, especially if they don&#8217;t have the time  to do much more than get them on the yellow bus. But if you live within rolling distance of the classroom, maybe you could make active transportation a part of your child&#8217;s daily routine this year by putting them on the <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/09/08/epic-150-kid-bike-bus-shows-america-a-better-way-to-get-to-school/">bike bus</a> instead — by starting one in your local district.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>4. Honor a crash victim</h2>
<p>Car crash victims are rarely memorialized in the public realm. Maybe this should be the year you join your local ghost bike crew, or start your own — or maybe, you can dream big and create a permanent, mass memorial to victims of traffic violence, like <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/18/a-grove-grows-in-brooklyn-finally-new-york-has-a-memorial-to-road-violence-victims/">this one in New York City. </a></p>

<h2>5. Don&#8217;t take bus delays lying down</h2>
<p>On-time service is a must for a functioning transit network. That&#8217;s why this Streetsblog reader&#8217;s resolving to speak up when the bus doesn&#8217;t come, on behalf of themselves and other riders who deserve better.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re at it, maybe write a follow-up email to your legislators advocating for <a href="https://bush.house.gov/imo/media/doc/bus_rapid_transit_act_one_pager.pdf">bus rapid transit</a>, real-time arrival screens, and more resources to transit agencies in general.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Commit to sending in a written complaint every time the bus doesn’t show up/is more than 3 minutes late</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>6. Learn about an under-the radar sustainable city</h2>
<p>Maybe you read some <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/07/21/four-myths-about-car-light-cities-busted/">excellent books</a> about sustainable transportation superstar cities in Europe in 2022. In 2023, though, why not challenge yourself to learn about some countries that are less famous, but no less incredible at creating people-centered design?</p>
<p>If you have the resources, you might even start planning a trip to <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/12/08/five-lessons-on-sustainable-transportation-from-colombia/">visit one of them for yourself</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two years ago I wanted learn about/from cities that aren&#39;t always a part of mainstream urbanism discourse. Places like CDMX, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Medellin, Istanbul, etc.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>7. Learn about taking direct action for safe streets</h2>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re not saying you should do anything illegal in your quest for safer streets, and you should certain never deface public property with anything as heinous as high-visibility paint &#8230; but there certainly are a lot of resources on how to do its safely and effectively if you&#8217;re curious.</p>

<h2>8. Share the joy</h2>
<p>We write a lot here at Streetsblog about all the terrible things that happen when you don&#8217;t put people first in the transportation space. It&#8217;s just as important, though, to acknowledge all the amazing things that happen when you do — and how much more fun, peaceful, and free life can be when we <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/08/12/opinion-slow-transportation-should-be-a-human-right/">slow down</a> and experience life at human scale.</p>
<p>So every time you get angry at a driver for side-swiping a pedestrian or a policymaker for dropping the ball on a critical law – which you should! — let&#8217;s challenge ourselves to take a moment to share why walking, biking, navigating your city independently with an assistive device, and taking shared transportation is such a powerful form of <a href="https://www.akpress.org/pleasure-activism.html">pleasure activism.</a> And make a point to share that message with people who might have forgotten just how joyful it can be.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m also planning to share more about the joy of sustainable transportation!</p>

We talked about how the system works in the so-called Motor City, how bike-share riders and bus riders coincide, the benefits of electric bikes, and coordination with other organizations.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who prefers to read than to listen, check out an edited transcript below the player. If you want a full unedited transcript, <a href="https://theoverheadwire.com/2022/12/unedited-podcast-transcript-413-biking-further-in-detroit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a> (but remember: there will be typos).</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Wood: You surveyed riders about travel habits and bus and the bike connections. What did the report tell you about these different groups of riders?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob Graham: The report showed us that cash is the primary way that people pay for the bus. That wasn’t a surprise, but to see the numbers laid out so starkly was really important when we are thinking about people combining trip methods because MoGo and all micro mobility that I’m aware of is credit- or debit-card forward, whereas bus systems tend to be cash forward — and certainly DDOT and Smart in our region are very cash forward systems. The buses don’t take credit cards. They’ve recently launched a payment app, but it’s pretty limited at this point and the use of it is very limited.</p>
<p>So to work with the high percentage of cash users on the bus network and the high percentage of credit card users on the bike share network is a major challenge we identified. Something that was <em>less</em> of a surprise was the location of stations. We really found that a lot of bus riders did not know where the nearest MoGo station was relative to their bus stop. And so there’s a couple responses that we can make to that. Some of that is just signage — helping people through wayfinding.</p>
<p>But a bigger, more expensive piece of that is moving those stations or adding new stations that are closer to a bus stop so that when someone gets on or off the bus, ideally they don’t even need signage to find the MoGo station. Ideally it’s there and it’s very visible. Of course there are some limitations to that because you can get on and off the bus, you know, northbound, southbound, eastbound, westbound. We’re not very close to having a MoGo station on any set of four corners anytime soon. We like to think that we’re doing well, but maybe we don’t have that kind of cash to be on all four corners of an intersection just yet.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let&#8217;s end the 2022 Streetsies by celebrating just a few of the transportation heroes who made us proud this year — and inspired us to be even better advocates in 2023.</p>
<p>First up; the<strong> Hawai&#8217;i kids who sued their state DOT</strong> for robbing them of a safe and livable future and their present-day sense of safety and joy, not to mention ancient cultural practices unique to Aloha State communities. We&#8217;d say we want to be them when we grow up, but the youngest of them is just nine years old.</p>

<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a little bit of a humblebrag, but <strong>Gabe Klein </strong>was on the Streetsblog USA board before he stepped down for a pretty compelling reason: he secured a job with the Biden White House as the head of the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. Now that it&#8217;s no longer technically a conflict of interest, we&#8217;re happy to throw the new Electric Vehicle Czar a Streetsie, particularly because of how often he reminds America that electric vehicles include <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/11/23/gabe-klein-energy-transportation/">electric bikes. </a></p>

<p>One long time Safe Streets luminary we got to know even better this year was <strong>Charles T. Brown</strong>, who launched the indispensable Arrested Mobility podcast in February, which explores  what we can do &#8220;to change the outcomes when people of color step out their door to exist in the world.&#8221; Brown was kind enough to let us share an episode his show on our own newly-launched podcast, <em>The Brake</em>, but we think<a href="https://arrestedmobility.com/episodes/"> every episode</a> should be required listening for Streetsblog fans.</p>

<p>National Transportation Safety Board Chair <strong>Jennifer Homendy </strong>is a tireless champion for systemic reform in the transportation realm, but she sent a particularly powerful message early this year when she slammed the pernicious myth that &#8220;94 percent of car crashes are caused by human error.&#8221; NHTSA removed it from its website soon after.</p>

<p>Finally, a special Streetsie for <strong>Dan Langenkamp,</strong> who became one of 2022&#8217;s most impactful safe streets advocates for a tragic and all too-common reason: he lost his wife, celebrated U.S. diplomat Sarah Langeknamp, to a truck crash in August when she was riding her bike in Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p>Dan shares this award with the more than<strong> 1,500 cyclists who joined him on the Ride For Your Life</strong> to the nation&#8217;s capitol in November to demand a slate of actions to save lives. Congress at least partially came through on one of those requests, with the announcement that it would devote $45 million to the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program program as part of the 2023 omnibus funding bill. We should all keep fighting to make sure it gets the full $200 million authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — and everything else we can to make sure no one ever dies in a car crash on U.S. roads again.</p>

<p>A lot of the most exciting developments on U.S. streets in 2022 didn&#8217;t originate in the halls of government. Today, we&#8217;re looking at projects from everyday people that made a big difference — and might inspire a few New Year&#8217;s resolutions in 2023.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s awards just go to show you that Margaret Mead was right: you should never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it&#8217;s the only thing that ever has.</p>
<p>First up is the <strong>bike bus, </strong>which finally had its big<em> </em>moment in the U.S. this year after decades as a mainstay of the daily school route overseas.</p>
<p>Special high five to friend of Streetsblog and America&#8217;s favorite Portland P.E. teacher Sam Balto, who&#8217;s worked tirelessly for years to make this great idea go viral.</p>

<p>Another Portlander who deserves a Streetsie is Cathy Tuttle, who created her own DIY <strong>car master plan</strong> to reduce automobile use in her city, flipping the script on the ubiquitous pedestrian and cycling master plans that pretty much every city puts out. We love seeing citizens re-write the narrative about their local transportation networks (As part of her project, also Cathy created a framework for understanding the &#8220;<a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/05/17/there-are-just-four-types-of-drivers-and-ending-car-dependency-means-reaching-them-all/">four types of drivers</a>&#8221; on U.S. that sparked a massive conversation of its own.)</p>

<p>A league of street-focused superheroes stepped out of the shadows  in April of 2022 with the formation of the <strong>Freeway Fighters Network</strong>, and they&#8217;ve been working together to tear down toxic highways in U.S. cities ever since.

<p>Reimagining a car-dominated landscape as a people-focused paradise can be hard — at least without a little help. Zach Katz&#8217; <strong>AI street renderings </strong>inspired a cool conversation about everything U.S. streets can be when we don&#8217;t put automobiles at the center, and a <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/08/24/opinion-how-dall-e-2-can-be-a-valuable-tool-in-the-fight-for-safer-streets/">how-to</a> for advocates who want to make their own.</p>

<p>Finally, good old-fashioned<strong> tactical urbanism </strong>also saw a big resurgence in 2022, thanks to a few cities&#8217; short-sighted decision to erase the DIY crosswalks their residents had painted. Of course, we would <em>never</em> encourage you to follow the lead of folks like the <a href="https://la.streetsblog.org/2022/04/27/crosswalks-collective-l-a-posts-instructions-for-diy-crosswalks/">L.A.

<p>U.S. gun deaths increased sharply in the first year of the pandemic, 2020, with the rise so steep among young people that the National Institutes of Health <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/od/directors_corner/prev_updates/gun-violence-July2022" rel="noopener">issued a bulletin</a> this July calling gun violence “the leading cause of childhood death.”</p>
<p>That framing has been catching fire. In a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https://marcommnews.com/northwell-health-launches-ferocious-tiger-by-strawberryfrog/&amp;psig=AOvVaw3xGsKesIrxCnMXJmMIZ-sI&amp;ust=1671734219555000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCLDD472ti_wCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">major ad campaign</a>, New York State’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwell_Health">largest healthcare provider</a>, Northwell Health, has been calling out guns as “The #1 Killer of Kids.” Earlier this month the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/14/magazine/children-gun-violence-project-explained.html">devoted its Sunday magazine</a> to portraits of children killed by gun violence, which the paper described as “the leading cause of death for American kids.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_491475" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1379px" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491475"><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/northwell-nyt-graphic.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-491475 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/northwell-nyt-graphic.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=769" sizes="(min-width: 80em) 1280px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 1280px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 768px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 768px,1379px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/northwell-nyt-graphic.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=769 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/northwell-nyt-graphic.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=616 1024w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/northwell-nyt-graphic.jpg?w=768&amp;h=462 768w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/northwell-nyt-graphic.jpg?w=512&amp;h=308 512w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/northwell-nyt-graphic.jpg?w=1379&amp;h=829 1379w" alt="The Northwell Health ad alongside the NY Times Sunday magazine cover from Dec. 21.

<p>The <i>New Yorker</i> writer Jelani Cobb deployed the same framing in his <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/26/brittney-griner-and-the-role-of-race-in-diplomacy">“Talk of the Town” column</a> leading the Dec. 26 edition of the magazine, castigating the Republican Party for making “access to firearms so obscenely sacrosanct that <b>guns have become the leading cause of death for American children</b>” (emphasis added). That Cobb is dean of the Columbia Journalism School and was addressing a somewhat separate subject than gun violence — his column was titled “Brittney Griner and the Role of Race in Diplomacy” — demonstrates how deeply this new mythos is permeating public discourse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The portraits of gun violence victims in the Times are heartbreaking, the numbers damning. In an April <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2201761">letter</a> to the New England Journal of Medicine, University of Michigan researchers reported that from 2019 to 2020, “the relative increase in the rate of firearm-related deaths … among children and adolescents was 29.5 percent — more than twice as high as the [13.5 percent] relative increase in the general population.”</p>
<p>Any 30-percent jump in deaths among any group from any cause in a single year demands attention. That firearm-involved deaths among people younger than 20 increased by nearly a thousand* in 2020 from a year earlier is almost unfathomable as well as unconscionable.</p>
<p>The scourge of gun deaths of young people absolutely warrants a full-court press from U.S. media and health officials and providers. But that’s no less true for motor vehicles, considering that <b>cars and other motorized traffic are still far and away the biggest killer of U.S. kids — </b>“kids” as society has traditionally defined them: persons younger than the teenage years.</p>
<p>The first bar graph shows that in 2020, for each individual age “cohort” through age 12, U.S. deaths from traffic crashes exceeded deaths from firearm deaths.</p>

<p>Through age 12, more than 500 more U.S. kids died in vehicle crashes in 2020 than were killed with firearms. But the numbers flip beginning with age 13, and emphatically. For ages 13 through 19, firearms killed more than 1,000 more teens than did traffic crashes. (See chart below right.)</p>

<p>As a result, total gun deaths for the 0-19 cohort were, indeed, the greater of the two. That’s the finding the N.I.H. reported this summer, yet mistakenly labeled as “childhood deaths,” a framing that Northwell, the <em>Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em> amplified this month.</p>
<p>As it happens, the age 12-13 break point between the primacy of traffic deaths and the primacy of gun deaths coincides with customary notions of childhood and adolescence. That custom resides in both language (“13” being the first “teenage” year) and biology, and is rooted in scientific discourse.</p>
<p>The U of M letter cited earlier, for example, is structured around that very distinction, as can be seen in its title, “Current Causes of Death in Children and Adolescents in the United States.” The American Psychological Association’s <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/childhood">dictionary</a> similarly defines childhood as “the period between the end of infancy (about 2 years of age) and the onset of puberty, marking the beginning of <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/adolescence">adolescence</a> (10–12 years of age).”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A subsidiary APA definition even cuts off childhood much earlier, after age 7. And just last week, a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/health/gun-deaths-children-covid.html">story</a> on the sharp rise in homicides of young people in 2020, did get it right, with the headline, “Homicides of Children Soared in the Pandemic’s First Year” and the subhead, “Killings of children and teenagers under 18 increased sharply.” It affirmed the conception of children and teenagers as separate categories.</p>
<p>Is it “just semantics” to insist that in 2020 cars killed more kids in the U.S. even though guns killed more of our young people overall? No. Constructs shape perception, and perceptions influence policy responses and, through them, the world we inhabit.</p>
<p>Any young person’s death is an immense tragedy, reverberating through communities and afflicting generations. Joy and wonderment gone in a moment, promise glimpsed but forever unfulfilled. The devastation is compounded when the deaths are ostensibly accidental, but actually preventable, as we know from the <a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(15)01030-X/fulltext#:~:text=The%252520firearm%252520homicide%252520rate%252520is,in%252520other%252520high%25252Dincome%252520countries.&amp;text=Among%252520all%25252023%252520countries%25252C%252520with,82%252525%252520of%252520all%252520firearm%252520deaths.">order-of-magnitude excess</a> of the U.S. firearm death rate of young people vs. other high-income countries and our <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-03/why-us-traffic-safety-fell-so-far-behind-other-countries">two-fold or greater excess</a> for traffic death rates.</p>
<p>Yes, children are uniquely vulnerable, but they are also talismanic in shaping public priorities. The current framing threatens to subordinate vehicle dangers to firearm dangers when in fact both dangers are out of control. A U.S. safety establishment that has almost never meaningfully addressed vehicle dangers for any segment of the population has no business marginalizing motor traffic’s menace to children or anyone else.</p>
<p><em>Data/methodology: I downloaded 2020 fatality figures via the Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/">online database</a>. Motor vehicle occupants, pedestrians and “pedalcyclists” are reported separately and had to be aggregated. For some age cohorts, pedestrian and especially cyclist fatality figures were too small (single-digit) and thus were “suppressed” in the data. I approximated them by calculating the “missing” deaths from the category total and distributing them by prorating the cohorts’ percentages of occupant deaths.</em></p>
<p><em>* The University of Michigan researchers’ letter identifies “children and adolescents” as “persons … to 19 years of age.” From the CDC’s search engine, I calculated 4,368 firearm-involved fatalities in 2020. Dividing by 1.295, the 2019 fatality figure would be 3,373, implying an increase of 995 fatalities from 2019 to 2020 (the most recent year with full data).</em></p>

<p>Nor does the United Nations — yes, <em>that</em> United Nations — <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/18/mondays-headlines-an-award-from-the-freakin-u-n-edition/" rel="noopener">which gave Eckerson</a> a “lifetime achievement” award for his 1,000-plus films advocating the car-free lifestyle from all over the world. That’s an honor that he shares with virtually no one on the planet.</p>
<p>Not bad.</p>
<p>But did this so-called “Orson Welles of the street” let the accolade go to his head? Of course not — he spent the year doing pretty much what he’s always done: hitting the pavement to bring you video coverage of the livable streets movement.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to watch all the nominees and vote at the bottom for your favorite Streetfilms production (polls close Friday at 5 p.m.):</p>
<h2>Cargo bikes</h2>
<p>Eckerson <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/01/11/see-it-streetfilms-shows-how-cargo-bikes-are-revolutionizing-family-life-in-new-york/" rel="noopener">opened the year</a> with a look at a number of city families, shot over several months, loading up their conventional or electric cargo bikes with children, gear, groceries, and what-have-you for trips tooling around town, to the park, to the zoo, between boroughs, over bridges — you name it.</p>
<p>As a number of parents note in the video, the trend has accelerated during the pandemic, as families have sought alternatives to transit-riding and the city has built out protected bike lanes. Enjoy it here:</p>

<h2>School streets</h2>
<p>Concurrent with <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/24/danger-zones-chaotic-school-streets-threaten-city-children/" rel="noopener">Jesse Coburn’s ground-breaking investigation</a> into the danger that school kids face in New York City, Eckerson was also looking at the problem. His own coverage has taken him to streets in London, Paris and Barcelona, where they keep kids safer than we do in New York.</p>
<p>But that’s not true everywhere. In neighborhoods with successful open streets, going to and coming home from school is much safer. And the movement is growing. From his travels, Eckerson concluded, “It is easy to see that making the arrival environment outside safer for students to walk and bike is a popular idea. Watch the film here:</p>

<h2>The women’s ride</h2>
<p>This year’s edition of the annual family ride took place in The Bronx, which has long lagged on city efforts to make cycling safer.</p>
<p>About 200 people participated — and the film carries that unmistakable Eckerson messaging: People want to ride, even when it’s unsafe. So make it safer and even more will ride.</p>
<p>Watch the film here:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbZUU0bquHA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<h2>Jersey eats our lunch</h2>
<p>We foolishly didn’t post Streetsfilm’s video from Jersey City and Hoboken with principal photography during the Vision Zero Cities conference this fall, but it’s a mistake we regret. If anyone one film this year captures exactly how cities can make positive change, it’s this one.</p>
<p>Hoboken and Jersey City are simply way ahead on improving the streetscape for all road users. So it’s no surprise that both cities have dropped road fatalities to zero. Eckerson’s film shows how to really get stuff done for the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBX641dXuF4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Paris vs. NYC</p>
<p>If you need an <em>international</em> reminder of just how badly New York City trails in mode shift, check out Eckerson’s exhaustive film about all the changes that have been made over the last few years in the City of Light.</p>
<p>Some of your favorite livable streets activists also appear in the film, but best of all are the shots of Paris’s wide bike lanes and few cars. Trigger warning: It’s hard to watch this film without thinking, “Why can’t we have nice things?”</p>
<p>Watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jCFKCfdXHJA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>

<p>A lot of <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/12/26/the-2022-streetsie-award-policies-worth-applauding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great things</a> happened in the movement to end car dependency in 2022, but we&#8217;d be lying if we said it was all sunshine and roses. For a little year-end catharsis, let&#8217;s take a look back at the biggest bummers of the year — and start strategizing so history doesn&#8217;t repeat itself in 2023.</p>
<p>First, the big one: because federal roadway fatality totals are released on a roughly one-year delay, <strong>the stats on 2021&#8217;s</strong> <strong>pedestrian death crisis</strong> came out not too long ago, and they were <em>awful.</em> As in, the-worst-they-been-in-40-years awful. A horrifying 7,485 people lost their lives, and every single one of them mattered.</p>
<p>The good news? We know exactly how to stop it. The bad news? <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/early-estimates-traffic-fatalities-first-half-2022">Preliminary data for early 2022</a> is not looking all that much better.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve known for a long time that one of the biggest drivers of the pedestrian death crisis is SUVs, which experts found to be two to three times more likely to kill people on foot than smaller passengers cars<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2018/06/28/suvs-killing-americas-pedestrians/646139002/"> back in 2018.</a> In 2022, though, we learned some even more<strong> sobering new SUV stats: </strong>that their drivers are roughly<a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/03/17/study-megacar-drivers-up-to-4x-more-likely-to-hit-walkers-while-turning/"> four times more likely</a> to strike a walker while turning, and if the person they strike happens to be a child, that child is <em>eight </em>times more likely to die than if cars were smaller.</p>

<p>Another form of traffic violence that we learned was even worse than we thought this year? <strong>Vehicle-into-building crashes.</strong> And as <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/11/03/essay-five-car-crashes-over-100000-in-damages-and-no-answers/">this essay from Wyatt Gordon revealed,</a> those crashes can be devastating even when no one loses their life.</p>

<p>Another understudied roadway topic that started coming to light this year were <strong>autonomous driving safety, </strong>when NHTSA revealed that crashes involving the tech are more common than automakers like Tesla would have us believe. Another bummer? How little we seem to be willing to talk about all the ways that AVs <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/02/10/six-ways-avs-could-reshape-our-cities-and-not-for-the-better/"><em>don&#8217;t </em>address</a> the larger problems of car dependency.</p>

<p>One of the biggest bummers of <em>every </em>year, though is how disproportionately all the burdens of car culture fall on marginalized communities. Let&#8217;s set a collective resolution to make 2023 the year that we finally, actually center their needs — and reverse the trend on disturbing studies like these.</p>

<p>After a three-year hiatus we&#8217;re bringing back our year-end Streetsie Awards — and we&#8217;re starting with some good news.</p>
<p>Despite some significant bummers, street safety advocates posted some major legislative wins in 2022, and got the ball rolling on a few innovative initiatives that we hope will spawn copycats in 2023.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the standouts:</p>
<h2>Federal</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, 2022 was the first year that the U.S. Department of Transportation made it unequivocally clear that the only acceptable number of road deaths is zero, and outlined a plan<strong> </strong>to reach that goal. It&#8217;s not perfect, but the very existence of the <strong>the</strong> <strong>National Roadway Safety Strategy </strong>definitely deserves a Streetsie.</p>

<p>Another one for the not-perfect-but-still-a-big-deal files: <strong>the new greenhouse gas emissions rule </strong>that will require states, for the first time, to track their transportation sector emissions. Transportation for America&#8217;s Beth Osborne called it &#8220;our top ask for administrative action&#8221;; we call it Streetsie-worthy.</p>

<p>Thanks to the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, Pete Buttigieg started writing big checks to communities in 2022 – and a lot of them went to sustainable transportation projects. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re giving a nod to the folks behind <strong>US DOT&#8217;s discretionary grant programs </strong>for using their, well, discretion to prioritize sustainability, equity, and safety, even in programs for which those tenets aren&#8217;t the usual criteria. (Who would have thought a program aimed at improving freight delivery times could be used to <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/09/22/feds-finally-using-highway-money-to-tear-down-highways/">tear down a highway in Detroit</a>?

<p>A lot of communities are finally understanding why policing pedestrians for walking &#8220;wrong&#8221; is so dangerous, particularly for BIPOC.

<p>If at first you don’t succeed, dry dry again.</p>
<p>City transportation officials announced on Thursday that they will “fight” aggressively in Albany next year for passage of <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/s131" rel="noopener">a proposal</a> to lower the drunk driving threshold — a bill that has <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/S5117" rel="noopener">been</a> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/A2302" rel="noopener">proposed</a> <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/A4369" rel="noopener">more</a> or <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2013/A7565" rel="noopener">less</a> every year, yet never makes it out of committee.</p>
<p>The current legislation, carried by Sen. John Liu (D-Queens) and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon (D-Brooklyn), would change the law so that “driving while intoxicated” would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent, down from the current 0.08 percent. Many nations around the world have adopted that standard, but only <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/02/16/how-utahs-new-dui-law-reduced-drunk-driving/" rel="noopener">Utah</a> in the United States has the stricter threshold.</p>
<p>The bill was re-submitted in the last legislative session, but went nowhere, and will be re-introduced next year. Currently, a blood-alcohol level between 0.05 and 0.08 percent is called “driving while ability impaired,” but <a href="https://www.nysdwi.com/new-york-impaired-driving-overview/" rel="noopener">the punishment for it is far lower</a> than for the more egregious driving while intoxicated. Department of Transportation Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said that having two thresholds “is not helpful.”</p>
<p>“There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is,” Forgione said, adding that too many drivers consume a little alcohol only to “lose their inhibitions and good judgment and get behind the wheel thinking they are ‘not that drunk.’ And the consequences can be deadly.”</p>
<p>In 2021, 42 people were killed in crashes that police linked to drunk driving, up 60 percent from a three-year average in previous years of 27, the DOT said. Forgione estimated that lowering the blood-alcohol threshold would reduce traffic fatalities by 10 percent — which is almost exactly <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/02/16/how-utahs-new-dui-law-reduced-drunk-driving/" rel="noopener">what Utah found</a> after it lowered its threshold in 2019.</p>

<p>The announcement of the first part of the city’s upcoming legislative push in Albany came at a presser on Thursday outside 1 Police Plaza that also featured messaging (right) about the NYPD’s coming crackdown on drunk driving and an education campaign aimed at reducing drunk driving.</p>
<p>The messaging did not explictly advise drivers to simply not drive when they are going to an event where alcohol will be offered. <a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1897" rel="noopener">Studies show</a> that a key reason that people drive drunk — beyond the drinking part of it — is that they’ve already driven to an event and don’t want to leave their car.</p>
<p>And very few drivers realize just <em>how little</em> booze it takes to a blood alcohol content of .05 percent; researchers say it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4448946/#:~:text=A%20reasonable%20standard%20to%20set,a%20137-pound%20female).">roughly equates</a> to a 185-pound man drinking <em>four</em> alcoholic beverages on an empty stomach over a two-hour period, or a 154-pound woman having three drinks. Decades of studies have shown that drivers who blow a 0.05 are <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/how-alcohol-impairs-your-ability-to-drive#:~:text=Studies%20dating%20back%20to%20the,risk%20is%202.69%20times%20higher.">1.38 times more likely</a> to be involved in a collision than a sober motorist — and drivers who blow an 0.08 are <em>2.69 </em>times more likely to crash.</p>
<figure id="attachment_491449" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 273px" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491449"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-491449 " src="https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-mcmorris.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=1792" sizes="(min-width: 80em) 1280px,(min-width: 64em) and (max-width: 80em) 1280px,(min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 64em) 1024px,(min-width: 32em) and (max-width: 48em) 768px,(max-width: 32em) 512px,(max-width: 48em) 768px,2406px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-mcmorris.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=1792 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-mcmorris.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=1434 1024w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-mcmorris.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1075 768w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-mcmorris.jpg?w=512&amp;h=717 512w,https://i0.wp.com/nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-mcmorris.jpg?w=2406&amp;h=3369 2406w" alt="Andrew McMorris was killed by a drunk driver in 2018." width="273" height="382" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-491449" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew McMorris was killed by a drunk driver in 2018.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So Streetsblog asked both Royster and Forgione why the drunk driving messaging was so focused on getting drivers not to <em>drink</em> rather than getting drivers not to <em>drive </em>in the first place (put another way: “Don’t drive” is a shorter, more concise slogan than “Don’t drink and drive”).</p>
<p>Forgione said: “I completely agree with what you’re suggesting. What it’s all about is making deliberate, methodic plans for what you’re going to do. So if you are a driver and you’re making this flawed assumption that ‘I’ll hardly drink and I’ll be OK,’ that should <em>not</em> be part of the equation. Just assume you’re going to go to a party and you’re not going to be fit to be able to get home.”</p>
<p>Both neither Forgione nor Royster specifically said, “Don’t drive to the party,” so it fell to an advocate to put the day’s announcements in perspective.</p>
<p>“We want to start changing the idea behind this because it’s not about arresting everyone in New York State for DWI,” said Mothers Against Drunk Driving member Alisa McMorris, whose son, Andrew, was killed by a drunk driver in 2018. “We want people people to make choices <em>before</em> they leave their home.”</p>
<p>The city DOT does often urge drivers to not drive — such as on “Gridlock Alert” days. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2022/gridlock-alert-remind-tri-state-region.shtml" rel="noopener">This year, for example</a>, Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez kicked off the holiday season by telling New Yorkers that “sustainable transit options are always the best choice to get around New York City.”</p>
<p>“We encourage everyone to take transit, bike, or walk during upcoming Gridlock Alert Days,” he said.</p>
<p>But that was not the messaging on Thursday’s drunk-driving press conference. Royster consistently stressed how drivers should <em>behave</em> rather than focusing on the initial bad decision: to drive.</p>
<p>“Our message is simple here today: No matter what you drive, if you are stopped and you’re driving while you’re impaired, you will be arrested. No exceptions. No excuses. So do the right thing and call a friend to drive you home or take a taxi. Make the right choice behind the wheel.”</p>
<p>Even the Senate bill’s sponsor John Liu focused on urging drivers to not drive drunk rather than not drive at all.</p>
<p>“There is no simper way to reduce drunk driving than to keep drivers from getting behind the wheel after they’ve been drinking,” he said in a statement that ignored the simplest way to avoid not only drunk driving, but other reckless driving practices: to not drive at all.</p>

<p>In April, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/04/26/hurrah-for-j-f-k-promenade-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocates celebrated a vote by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors preserving the eastern half of J.F.K. Drive</a> as a car-free space. And why not? <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2021/08/23/eyes-on-the-garage-de-youngs-underappreciated-underground-attraction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motorists have an 800-space underground parking garage</a>, and MLK, and tunnels to access the interior of the park. It was the democratic conclusion to a decades-long battle to try and <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/05/03/qa-e-r-doctor-reflects-on-traffic-violence-and-the-j-f-k-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevent crashes</a> and make the park more of a, well, park.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t good enough for Wilsey and others who insist on unfettered car-access everywhere in the city. <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/07/12/trump-backer-dede-wilsey-buys-ballot-measure-to-return-cars-to-jfk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wilsey bankrolled a signature-gathering campaign</a> to get the J.F.K. Promenade decision overturned via plebiscite. Not only was she gunning for the J.F.K. Promenade, but she wanted to put cars back on the Great Highway, 24/7. <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/05/03/qa-e-r-doctor-reflects-on-traffic-violence-and-the-j-f-k-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To hell with the consequences</a>; cars everywhere all the time.</p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/07/12/trump-backer-dede-wilsey-buys-ballot-measure-to-return-cars-to-jfk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streetsblog predicted that Measure &#8220;I&#8221;, as her ballot measure would be named, was an overreach</a> and a terrible misread of the popularity of both of these spaces. Nevertheless, if &#8220;I&#8221; succeeded and &#8220;J&#8221; failed, the measure put on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors to enshrine the J.F.K. Promenade into the city charter, it would have been a disaster for safe-and-livable streets advocates.</p>
<p>So advocates returned to the ramparts and re-fought the battle as if their lives depended on it&#8211;<a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/05/03/qa-e-r-doctor-reflects-on-traffic-violence-and-the-j-f-k-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because they did</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the rest is history. <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/11/14/safe-streets-advocates-celebrate-j-f-k-triumph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not only did &#8220;I&#8221; fail and &#8220;J&#8221; succeed in November, but it wasn&#8217;t even close</a>. Nearly every electoral precinct affirmed that they have had enough of speeding drivers and the noise, pollution, and danger they bring to the park and the city.</p>
<p>It was, in the end, the best thing that could have happened.</p>
<p>Without the clear results in this election, would the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/car-free-embarcadero-17661965.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and other major players in the mainstream media have given any ink to a plan to make the Embarcadero car free</a>? Would <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/11/18/spur-talk-bury-or-tear-down-us-101-and-the-central-freeway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a complete tear-down of the Central Freeway</a> be getting so much traction? Now, with such a strong affirmation of everything this publication and its allies fight for, anything is possible.</p>
<p>As a region, of course, we are still decades behind <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/09/01/qa-dutch-safety-experts-coming-to-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our counterparts in Europe</a> (and we&#8217;re <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/03/24/studying-the-parisian-bike-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling further behind</a>) when it comes to safe streets. Fights continue to rage for safe streets in Emeryville, Oakland, Marin, the Peninsula, Berkeley, Contra Costa, and elsewhere. There have been <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/12/07/victories-for-safe-streets-on-both-sides-of-the-bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant victories throughout the Bay Area</a>.</p>
<p>But sadly, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/06/21/hearing-on-14th-street-safety-project-comes-on-heels-of-another-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the death and horror on our streets</a> continues.</p>

<p>As editor of Streetsblog, 2022 has been <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/07/28/commentary-i-crashed-on-a-dangerous-grate-in-golden-gate-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhausting and sometimes painful</a>&#8211;as I&#8217;m sure it was for all of our friends at the various advocacy groups.</p>
<p>Streetsblog San Francisco will be taking a hiatus for the remainder of 2022. My hope is Streetsblog will have more resources next year to cover and highlight the next big fights&#8211;getting protected bike lanes around the rest of Lake Merritt in Oakland, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/08/16/fare-integration-takes-one-step-forward-one-step-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seamless Bay Area will continue its push to get  better transit services</a>, the push will continue against <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/09/21/caltrans-continues-widening-this-time-in-south-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caltrans&#8217;s constant excuses for widening roads</a>, and, one hopes, advocates can finally <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/09/19/sfmta-re-proposes-ridiculous-center-running-valencia-bike-lanes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make San Francisco fulfill its broken promises on Valencia</a>. There are so many fights it&#8217;s impossible to mention them all here. But right now, as 2022 winds down, let&#8217;s celebrate the J.F.K. Promenade victory as a beacon of hope and accomplishment and a guide to what&#8217;s possible moving forward.</p>
<p>And please consider giving to Streetsblog to help us expand our abilities to cover these issues.</p>

<p>The massive new federal funding bill making its way through Washington includes $45 million in much-needed funds for active transportation projects — but it&#8217;s still a tiny fraction of what American communities actually need.</p>
<p>As part of the $1.7-trillion <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF">Consolidated Appropriations Act</a> released Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee announced that it would finally fund the new Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program established under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will issue discretionary grants to help U.S. communities address dangerous gaps in their bike lane, sidewalk, and multi-use trail networks.</p>
<p>That great news was soured slightly, though, by the dollar figure attached to it. Though Congress has the authority to give the active transport program up to $200 million a year for the next five years, the funding bill would grant it just $45 million for fiscal year 2023 — which is less than <em>10 percent</em> of the annual <a href="https://www.railstotrails.org/media/1173656/caats_atiip_2922.pdf">$500 million</a> advocates initially requested.</p>
<p>To put it that in perspective, communities seeking to build new infrastructure using funds from the new program (rather than applying for planning grants, which the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program will also fund) will need to submit projects with total costs in excess of <a href="https://www.railstotrails.org/policy/funding/active-transportation-infrastructure-investment-program/">$15 million.</a> That means that just three communities could consume the entire pot of funding, if their poverty rates were high enough to meet the criteria for a 100-percent federal share — and that&#8217;s not even taking into account the administrative costs of running the program itself.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite the blow, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy spokesperson Brandi Horton called the news &#8220;a major victory for trail and active transportation networks&#8221; that will &#8220;kick-start the long-overdue program&#8221; — and hopefully, prompt a deluge of applications that will inspire Congress to give the active transportation program more money next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus will be on generating as many applications as possible to demonstrate the breadth of demand for this type of investment in trail and active transportation networks,&#8221; Horton added.</p>
<p>That probably won&#8217;t be challenging. According to a recent Rails-to-Trails <a href="https://www.railstotrails.org/media/1332783/letter_to_usdot_re_fy24-atiip_appropriations.pdf">survey</a> of planners and active transportation nonprofits, U.S. communities have &#8220;over $7 billion in unmet need to fill gaps in active transportation systems&#8221; — a fraction of the $110 billion a year that Congress authorized for U.S. highway agencies under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but 155 times <em>more</em> than they&#8217;ll get from the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program program this year under the current funding bill.</p>

<p>Another way lawmakers could help address America&#8217;s active transportation backlog is through transportation-focused earmarks, <a href="https://twitter.com/JDwithTW/status/1605566332799520768">$1.6 billion</a> of which are peppered throughout the new spending bill —at least if GOP lawmakers don&#8217;t seize on those projects as a pretense to derail the entire package.</p>
<p>One particular line item that elicited Republican opprobrium was the inclusion of $3.6 million for the Michelle Obama Trail in Decatur. Ga., which will fund safety improvements on an already existing 3.8 mile off-road path that connects several neighborhoods with local schools and recreation centers. A flurry of electeds <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/michelle-obama-trail-funding-omnibus-bill-republican-fury-1768635">took to Twitter</a> to decry the trail, which Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) derided as &#8220;woke nonsense,&#8221; prompting journalist Tanya Ray Fox to comment that, &#8220;Y<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">ou</span> <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">know</span> <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">conservatives</span> <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">have</span> <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">really</span> <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">lost</span> <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">the</span> <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">thread</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> when they think naming hiking trails after famous Americans is woke.&#8221; (It should be noted that t</span>he gaggle of other active transportation and trail projects on the <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Division%20L%20-%20THUD%20Statement%20FY23.pdf#page=115">37-page list</a> that are <em>not</em> named after the former First Lady generated substantially less controversy.)</p>
<p>Even the most self-avowed fiscal hawks were silent, though, on the <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HIGHLIGHTS%20DOCUMENT%20FY%2023.pdf">$3.4 billion</a> that the bill will flex from the general fund to cover Highway Trust Fund shortfalls — because gas taxes paid for by drivers <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/01/21/drivers-pay-4x-more-for-cell-phones-than-roads/">don&#8217;t come anywhere close</a> to funding America&#8217;s ever-growing network of auto-centric roads (not to mention that electric cars are cutting into gas tax revenues).</p>
<p>Lawmakers have until Friday at midnight to negotiate the final terms of the deal ahead of the Christmas and New Year&#8217;s holidays, or face an expiration of the fiscal year 2022 funding bill that would force a government shut down.</p>

<p>On a spring day not long ago, John Bauters was waiting for a bus in the Bay Area city of Emeryville, Calif. — where he is mayor — when he noticed that a passenger at the stop across the street had nowhere to sit. The man, who was older and used a cane, was forced to lean against a trash can for support, and he looked like he was struggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;[And I thought], if there&#8217;s one more senior who can choose to stay independent in my city because we provided a bus seat to them — because in the absence of that, they don&#8217;t have mobility choices — I&#8217;m going to put a bus seat there,&#8221; Bauters said. &#8220;As unsexy as that may seem to some folks, that matters to me.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am embarrassed that this man is leaning on a city trash can to support himself while he waits for the bus. I see you, friend. Working on it. <a href="https://t.co/fPw3nFtF5Z">pic.twitter.com/fPw3nFtF5Z</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mayor John J. Bauters (@JohnBauters) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnBauters/status/1502759468018266114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bauters eventually made good on his vow to give his fellow bus riders a place to sit — something he was uniquely well-positioned to do. In just seven months, he and his staff installed a quick-build bench called a &#8220;simmeseat&#8221; at every stop in town that didn&#8217;t already have one, and sparked a conversation online about why other local leaders haven&#8217;t done the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those things that doesn&#8217;t need to be studied,&#8221; Bauters added. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to study whether or not people need to sit — especially people who are older, people have mobility issues, people with children, people who&#8217;ve walked a long the way, or who are carrying things.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We said we would quick build and install seats at every bus stop in our city before the end of the year. And then we did it. I am grateful to the <a href="https://twitter.com/EmeryvilleCA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EmeryvilleCA</a> Public Works Department and staff. I am so proud to serve this community. <a href="https://t.co/wxlnnWoAdd">https://t.co/wxlnnWoAdd</a> <a href="https://t.co/o3Yenex8VU">pic.twitter.com/o3Yenex8VU</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mayor John J. Bauters (@JohnBauters) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnBauters/status/1598046623489146881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Given that his city has a population of just 13,000 and only 50 seatless stops to tackle, Bauters acknowledges that his project may not seem like a big deal to everyone — and they’d first have to realize what a big deal an inadequate seating can be to a weary passenger. <a href="https://transitcenter.org/publication/sorry-to-superb/">Studies have shown</a> that the presence of benches and other transit amenities (read: basics) like shelters and nearby trees can encourage ridership and even decrease perceived wait time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many communities struggle to provide riders places to rest. In Los Angeles, roughly <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-12/amid-blistering-heat-bus-riders-wait-in-search-of-shade">half of all stops are currently benchless</a>, while in nearby San Francisco,<a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/san-francisco-bus-stops/"> nearly two-thirds</a> are; other large agencies don&#8217;t even make stop amenity data available.</p>
<figure style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="" src="https://johnbauters.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bauters-shelter.jpg" width="340" height="227" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo: <a href="https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/author/johnbauters/">John Bauters</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bauters believes, though, that his efforts in Emeryville are scalable to larger places — and he emphasizes that even his small city was not immune to the challenges of tight budgets and narrow rights-of-way where private property lines sometimes encroach on scarce bus stop space. Even as they continue to work towards more comprehensively redesigning stops in the long term, he says city staff didn&#8217;t hesitate to commit to an affordable, doable solution that would meet riders&#8217; baseline needs now, rather than forcing them to wait for a spendy permanent fix.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of things that politicians put forward for their community as improvements are often [presented] as these grand plans, these visionary things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But some of the most important and best things that we can do to improve livability and transportation choices in our city often go unnoticed by the vast majority of people, but they&#8217;re greatly and deeply appreciated by the people who are in need. &#8230; It’s about leadership. It’s about setting priorities, prioritizing your resources, including your human resources, and not looking at it as, &#8216;We can only operate in way we’ve always operated.&#8217; … I do think it&#8217;s scalable and translatable.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also stresses that great projects don&#8217;t have to come from the top down.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be a mayor,&#8221; Bauters added. &#8220;You can be the council person; you can be the planning commissioner; you can be on your local parks and rec committee, for that matter. It&#8217;s about how you choose to do the job.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XeO8M4tfV5I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps what&#8217;s most remarkable about Bauters&#8217;s bus stop blitz, though, is that it&#8217;s only one small piece of a much larger push to make life better in the Emeryville region – and not just on its roads. Though he&#8217;s gaining a national reputation as a bus stop improver and &#8220;America&#8217;s bike mayor&#8221; for his <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Meet-the-Bay-Area-mayor-who-wants-to-convince-you-17029894.php">ambitious transportation plans</a>, he says he ran on a more holistic platform of &#8220;livability, accessibility, sustainability and equitability.&#8221; He just happens to find many of the most promising opportunities to push that mission forward when he&#8217;s out doing everyday things in his community, like waiting for the bus — something he says other elected officials <a href="https://transloc.com/blog/your-mayor-should-be-riding-the-bus/">could stand to do more. </a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I’m on a scavenger hunt to find these [problems],&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when you are out every day, you talk to people. You can&#8217;t have the kind of conversations I have when you&#8217;re in a car.&#8221;</p>

<p>New York State has been underfunding the MTA by hundreds of millions of dollars for decades, quietly regifting dedicated taxes as its own legally obligated contribution to the transit agency’s operating budget.</p>
<p>Under a transit funding law established in 1975 known as 18-b, New York State agreed to directly fund the operating budget of state public transit systems, including the MTA, with matching funds from local governments every year. In the case of New York City, it means that city taxpayers give more than $150 million annual towards funding New York City Transit. Additionally, taxpayers living in counties served by the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North also give the agency tens of millions of dollars from those counties’ general funds. The money from state and local governments is supposed to come from those governments’ general funds.</p>
<p>But for almost 30 years, New York State has shortchanged the MTA by reclassifying money existing regional taxes that’s already earmarked for the agency as money that the state is providing <em>on its own</em>. New York State has spent decades calling these dedicated taxes the state’s contribution from the general fund, even as every other county has held up its side of the bargain with a full contribution from its general fund.</p>
<p>The end result is that every year, the MTA is getting stiffed, with the amount rising to a shortfall of over $180 million per year since 2015.</p>
<p>The state’s process for skimping the MTA is hidden in the cosmic gumbo that is the appropriations process during the budget, and the way that dedicated taxes flow from cities and counties to the state. Despite the fact that the 12 counties served by the MTA pay specialized regional taxes that fund the Mass Metropolitan Transit Operating Assistance fund (MMTOA), those taxes such as the petroleum business tax or regional sales tax surcharge don’t immediately get earmarked for transit. Instead, they gets lumped in with every other dollar that goes into the state’s general fund.</p>
<p>From there, the MMTOA taxes are appropriated to the MTA in the course of the normal budget process. But for decades now Albany leaders have agreed that up to 90 percent of the state’s share of its 18-b contribution can just be a slice of the MMTOA taxes that need to be appropriated to the MTA anyway. The state then calls that money a contribution from the general fund, despite the fact that this money is coming from dedicated MTA taxes.</p>
<p>State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli dates the annual 18-b shortchange back to 1995, when the state pinched $128 million of MMTOA money. By 2008, the raids had become enough of an issue that DiNapoli’s “Financial Outlook For the MTA Report” <a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/report-5-2009.pdf">explicitly called the practice a raid</a> (in so many words).</p>
<p>“As we have pointed out in the past, the state has used a portion of these resources (since 1995) to fund up to 90 percent of its statutory obligation to subsidize the MTA’s operating budget, rather than using General Fund revenues as originally intended,” DiNapoli wrote. “Consequently, the MTA has been shortchanged by $2.2 billion since 1995, and will lose out on $709 million during calendar years 2009 through 2012.”</p>
<p>That was the projection of 10 years ago. By now, the amount of state money owed to the MTA is an astounding $4.9 billion. Although the money is a relatively small amount of the total budget every year, the point remains that the 18-b law is not set up to allow the state to slap its name on already dedicated funding.</p>
<p>“This is not the spirit of the law,” said Rahul Jain, the state’s deputy comptroller for the city. “The point was that local governments need to put in half, the state will put in half, and that is separate from what MMTOA is supposed to represent. It’s correct to treat them as two separate things.”</p>
<p>Representatives for the MTA declined to comment on the raids. However, the agency has not been shy about noting the chicanery if it can do so buried safely inside financial disclosures that only <a href="https://twitter.com/davecoion" rel="noopener">nerds</a> read.</p>
<p>“An additional $175 million of MMTOA is annually earmarked to fund the State’s 18-b obligation to the MTA, which includes $154 million for NYCT/SIR and $21 million for the Commuter Railroads,” said the MTA’s <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/101136">Proposed Budget for 2023</a>. “These funds are appropriated by the state, and there is a required local 18-b match from New York City and the counties [in the service area].”</p>
<p>And in a footnote in the budget document, the agency wrote “State 18-b Operating Assistance is a statewide mass transportation program that provides direct state aid to the MTA, which is appropriated by the State Legislature on an annual basis. Since 1994, the state has funded most of its 18-b payments with MMTOA.”</p>
<p>The material of impacts of the raids have been hard to quantify every single year, but the MTA’s own budget presentation shows that the yearly raids could cover the higher-than-initially proposed fare hikes over the next few years. The MTA has said it could raise $50 million in 2023 and $100 million from 2024 through 2026 if it raises fares 5.5 percent instead of 4 percent. That amount of money is more than covered every year by the state’s decision to provide its “matching” funds for transit out of dedicated taxes that already are earmarked for the MTA.</p>

<p>Transparency advocates say that the increasingly dire fiscal circumstances for the budgets of transit agencies around the state means that this is not a time to play shell games with transit funding.</p>
<p>“Transit systems across New York State are in danger of collapsing once federal [Covid] funding runs out, so the state must finally deliver on its funding obligations to transit riders by no longer raiding dedicated funds and restoring its full 18-b general fund contribution,” said Reinvent Albany Senior Policy Advisor Rachael Fauss. “Ending the budget gimmicks won’t be enough, however, so the governor must also create new dedicated funds to support the long-term needs of transit agencies.”</p>
<p>It’s yet to be seen whether the practice will finally end in 2023. A spokesperson for Gov. Hochul declined to say whether the governor will end the practice of raiding the MMTOA funds, and instead pointed to the 11.8-percent increase in state aid to the MTA that was in this past year’s budget, an increase that was due to dedicated taxes coming in higher than they had during the years when the pandemic’s economic crunch wrecked state tax receipts, not from making the MTA whole on what it’s owed.</p>
<p>One high-ranking member of the Assembly sounded ready to stop the steal.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t around 30 years ago to know the original intent of 18-b,” said Assembly Member Amy Paulin, the chair of the Corporations Committee. “Regardless, we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.”</p>

<p>just returned from a trip to visit friends in two very different African countries, Zimbabwe and Rwanda. The trip purpose wasn’t to observe transportation customs and bring home lessons for California, but I couldn’t help myself from trying to take a picture whenever I saw someone using a bicycle.</p>
<p>That’s partly because they were relatively rare in Zimbabwe, and extremely common in Rwanda, and that piqued my interest – apart from just liking to see people on bikes.</p>

<p>Those two countries seem to exist on the opposite ends of the African spectrum in terms of economics and governmental organization. Both countries suffered terribly under colonial rule and its aftermath, and their paths away from that history have been completely unique.</p>
<p>For example, Zimbabwe seems to have gotten stuck in the 1980s, when the country succeeded in throwing off minority white rule but never quite recovered economically. While cars dominate travel, supplies are hard to come by for everything. So roads are sometimes more pothole than pavement, cars are old and spew smoke of many colors, and transit is cramming onto whatever vehicle is going your way.</p>
<p>Deciphering traffic is always a challenge in a new place, and in Zimbabwe lanes and intersections were mostly negotiated via eye contact. Few seem to drive aggressively, mostly because there isn’t much point to it. People riding bikes on busy roads frequently turn to look behind them, and vehicles pass quite closely.</p>

<p>There are a few clearly marked cycle tracks along some of the older streets (what we would call bike paths), especially in some of the colonial neighborhoods where jacarandas sweep long purple-blossomed branches overhead. However, those cycle tracks are as decrepit as the pavement on the roads – “a vestige of the colonial era, useless now,” was our host’s description of them. And few bicycles seem to be using them.</p>
<p>It feels like all the infrastructure in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city, has just taken a beating: roads are a mess; electric power comes and goes on a whim; water runs, sometimes; the postal service is nonexistent; transit consists mostly of “combis” or vans that haphazardly stop to pick up riders and their bags and baskets and squish them inside even when it doesn’t seem there’s any more room, and they let people hang off the back; formal taxi companies have disappeared.</p>
<p>So you’d think there would be a lot more bike riding. However, for bikes to really make sense the roads have to at least be decent – and here is one area in which Rwanda differs greatly from Zimbabwe. There, the main roads are well paved and have wide, sometimes striped shoulder lanes, with well-marked curbs and sidewalks along even some of the rural routes. The side roads are mostly dirt, but even those are at least more passable by bike than by car or truck or even the ubiquitous, buzzing motorcycle taxis.</p>

<p>And clearly the bike is a useful tool. People – mostly, but not all, young men – pile their single-speed, not electric, non-cargo bikes with heavy and precarious loads, sometimes to the point that they have to push the bikes up the frequent hills. Bikes carry large loads of potatoes (or cassava); tall gleaming milk cans; stacked crates full of bottles; giant bunches of bananas; paying passengers on plushy vinyl seats; furniture (whole beds, albeit unassembled). One bike carried a pyramid-shaped tower of meticulously stacked and tied chunks of coal. Eggs – a lot of eggs. Chickens in cages. Live goats. Haphazard loads of firewood and building materials. We saw one guy toting a coffin, which stuck out sideways on the rack behind him.</p>
<p>Passing cars gave him a wide berth.</p>
<p>Of course walking is also a common way to get around, and people walk long distances, despite the hills. They also carry a lot of stuff, wide loads upon their heads. Women balance stacked firewood, giant bunches of bananas, folded piles of clothing, and wide flat baskets holding neat arrangements of avocados, bananas, roasted corn. I saw several woman balancing hoes and axes, the tools’ blades cushioned on their head coverings, with the handle jutting out as a counterbalance.</p>

<p>Californians, we are wimps. My goodness, we are spoiled by not having to carry things. Seeing these heavy loads on heads and bike racks put all the arguments about whether electric cargo bikes can replace cars in a whole different light.</p>
<p>Being in the midst of what seemed at times a chaotic swirl of traffic was exhilarating, and also scary. But never did I feel I was in true danger (okay, once; when a driver from neighboring Burundi – where British-style drive is the norm – seemed genuinely confused about why our vehicle was heading straight towards his). There was no sense of aggression or pressure to get a move on, dammit, even when dark was coming on and the traffic heading into Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital, swirled in a chaotic ballet to avoid potholes, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Horns were used as a brief warning, from a distance – more a reminder that traffic was approaching than a demand for the right of way.</p>
<p>Crossing the street in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, was frightening the first few times. Pedestrians do not have any claim to a right of way. They must stop and wait, even at a crosswalk, for a gap in the traffic – but only between larger vehicles. Motorcycle drivers accommodate crossing pedestrians by adjusting their trajectory, and sometimes even acknowledge with a wave that they see you and all is okay.</p>
<p>It was disconcerting, however, how closely vehicles passed people. It was unnerving to be the passenger in a car on the highway, passing inches away from folks walking along the edge of the road. It was also unnerving to walk along a sidewalk and feel the wind from a passing car. One learns to pay attention, keep elbows tucked, and stay as far to the inside as other pedestrians will let you.</p>

<p>It was a big reminder of how many things we sometimes take for granted in California, things that don’t have to be the way they are. For example, the ways our car-dominant infrastructure encourages impatience and aggression; the way pedestrians and bicyclists are used to being utterly ignored or cussed out. (Within a few days of arriving home to California, I was sworn at by a driver mad that I was in a crosswalk he wanted to speed through; such a lovely welcome!).</p>
<p>But it’s clearly possible for traffic to be heavy without being mean. It’s possible for it to be a wild ballet of people, bikes, and cars, and still work for everyone.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s perhaps no greater contrast in infrastructure in San Francisco than <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/10/26/eyes-on-the-prize-the-upcoming-election-and-thoughts-about-how-far-weve-come/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">north and south of Market Street in downtown</a>. To the south is District 6 where, thanks to the hard work of former <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/11/30/qa-matt-haney-talks-about-climate-summit-in-egypt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supervisors Matt Haney</a> and <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/05/18/new-website-puts-faces-to-traffic-violence-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jane Kim before him</a>, there is now flawed-but-nevertheless-much-improved, parking-protected, bike infrastructure. And <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/12/07/op-ed-kearny-street-is-a-gateway-to-district-3-neighborhoods-it-must-be-redesigned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">District 3</a>, well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s pretty much the same sh*t show it&#8217;s always been, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2019/02/28/safety-washing-on-sansome-and-battery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featuring sharrows, striped door-zone bike lanes (sometimes on the wrong side of the street)</a> and total priority for motorists.</p>
<p>However, work is now underway on what the SFMTA is billing as the first major bike project in the district. More <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/construction-starts-batterysansome-quick-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the agency&#8217;s web page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project is a major step forward for cycling in the city. Apart from the Embarcadero, there is no other protected bike lane near the Financial District — even though two out of the 10 most active bike share stations in the city are in the downtown area. With so many people returning to downtown offices after working from home due to the pandemic, this new route will offer a safer option for those looking for a more active commute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s what it will look like when it&#8217;s finished:</p>

<p>Streetsblog received a nasty email from the Supervisor&#8217;s office back in 2019 when it published <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2019/02/28/safety-washing-on-sansome-and-battery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Safety-Washing on Sansome and Battery</em></a>, a take-down of an early phase of this supposed &#8220;quick build&#8221; safety project. And while what&#8217;s going in now is a minor improvement, with more delineation for cyclists, it&#8217;s scandalous just how far this two-lane, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/09/01/qa-dutch-safety-experts-coming-to-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unprotected bike lane still departs from international best practices</a>&#8211;and <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2021/02/11/commentary-use-physics-not-plastic-for-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physics</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/08/16/study-two-way-bike-lanes-produce-more-injuries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two-way bike lanes are pretty fraught</a>; but they <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2020/11/02/bike-east-bay-push-for-more-lakeside-bike-heaven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make sense along waterfronts</a> and rail yards and in other situations where there are no intersections. Otherwise, they invite conflicts with turning motorists. If a city is going to do a two-way on a street with big intersections <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2018/03/09/eyes-on-the-street-cargo-way-bike-lane-finally-gets-paved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then they must, at the very least, have concrete protection</a>. Signals and signs aren&#8217;t enough. The situation SFMTA is building for here almost guarantees a simple mistake by a motorist will result in serious injuries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s not as if the means and materials to properly protect the bike lanes aren&#8217;t already there, as seen with these planters between Jackson and Pacific. Just put these between motorists and cyclists to provide some real protection:</p>

<p>Is it too politically challenging to put in concrete protection? Even on the one block where they could provide protection without taking anything from the street, they fail to do so. Between Washington and Jackson there&#8217;s an enormous building setback and a huge sidewalk. Would it be Armageddon to paint the bike lane onto part of this space, where cyclists would be protected, in reality, for one damn block? That&#8217;s a place where it makes sense to use plastic posts&#8211;to segregate pedestrians walking from pedestrians rolling on two wheels (aka: cyclists).</p>

<p>SFMTA and the Supervisor&#8217;s office need to write this 1,000 times on the blackboard: cyclists (and scooterists) are pedestrians on wheels. They are not cars. And when delicate human bodies are mixed in with two-to-ten ton vehicles driven at high speeds, people end up getting maimed and killed, no matter how bright their clothes or whether or not they wear a Styrofoam bowl on their head.</p>
<p>Adding <a href="https://chi.streetsblog.org/2022/04/20/287k-injury-verdict-shows-using-flimsy-posts-to-protect-lanes-puts-cyclists-taxpayers-at-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little plastic bendy straws doesn&#8217;t change that reality</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/speedlimitsign.png?w=800"></p><!-- FeaturedImageEnd --><p>In a move that could be a model for other U.S. states, Oregon may soon allow cities more leeway to set lower speed limits on dangerous roads — rather than reserving that power for state transportation leaders whose primary interest, historically, has been moving cars as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Following an exhausting 13-year battle, the Beaver State legislature recently modified a law that required cities and counties to individually lobby the Oregon Department of Transportation every time they wanted to lower a speed limit in their communities, essentially giving non-local transportation leaders final say over how fast drivers should travel in places they don’t live.</p>
<p>As part of that onerous process, locals would have to wait between <a href="https://bikeportland.org/2022/11/30/a-13-year-effort-to-gain-local-control-of-speed-limits-is-over-367756">six and 12 months</a> to find out whether their safety would come first — and often, their requests were denied.</p>
<p>“We started bumping up against situations where the public would want these changes, and we would have to educate them about the fact that this issue is not entirely within our control,” said Dylan Rivera, a spokesperson for the Portland Bureau of Transportation, which spearheaded the campaign for the reform. “This is a long time coming.”</p>

<p>And much like communities in those states, Oregon cities still won’t have control over <em>every </em>limit, including those that are governed by state law — think the 65 mile per hour max on the interstate, or 20 miles per hour when children are present in school zones — and on state-controlled roads within city borders. And even on local roads, speed-setting authority won’t be given by right; cities will have to apply for it, and prove that they have enough engineers on staff to provide meaningful speed recommendations, which could be a stumbling block for smaller rural communities.</p>
<p>To help address those concerns, the Bureau of Transportation launched a <a href="https://bikeportland.org/2020/04/15/the-outdated-and-dangerous-85th-percentile-rule-is-dead-in-oregon-313665">parallel campaign</a> to get the state to ditch the infamous “85th percentile rule” in the speed limit assessments that will remain under its control. Rather than setting limits based on the what’s actually safe for all road users who might travel on a given corridor, U.S. traffic engineers are generally advised to measure the average speeds at which most motorists — specifically, all but the fastest 15 percent — decide <em>they </em>can safely travel, averaged over 24 hours worth of data that includes the middle of the night when roads are wide open and driving fast is the norm.</p>
<p>Now, many Oregon roads will be subject to a significantly safer<em> 50th</em> percentile rule, wherein the slowest half of drivers on the road will set the standard. State engineers will also have to consider the lived realities of those roads, including what businesses, services and residences are located along them, how they’re classified locally, and other more complex factors.</p>
<p>“We said to ourselves, ‘Well, they could delegate authority to us, but if we have to set speed limits with the same paradigm that ODOT had used authority, that wouldn’t necessarily achieve the safety improvements we were seeking,&#8217;” said Dana Dickman, safety section manager for PBOT. “These changes in methodology will allow us, as an agency, to have a deeper conversation about <em>their</em> state-owned roads that run through our city.”</p>

<p>Getting from a safe speed <em>limit</em> on a sign to a comprehensively<i> </i><a href="https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/design-controls/design-speed/"><em>design </em>speed</a> across an entire roadway environment, Rivera says, will sometimes require cities actually taking ownership of the dangerous corridors that ODOT maintains — as PBOT <a href="https://www.portland.gov/transportation/news/2022/4/28/news-release-portland-city-council-unanimously-approves-building">recently did</a> on deadly 82nd avenue — not to mention finding the money to transform them into human-scaled places.</p>
<p>“What we’ve found is that transferring ownership of a state highway to a city doesn’t in and of itself provide safety improvements,” added Rivera. “What does that is the change in ownership plus the resources to make those improvements happen … We need money to address deferred maintenance, to mark crosswalks where they haven’t existed and they’re overdue.”</p>
<p>Rivera is clear, though, that Portland isn’t shying away from the sometimes complex challenges of slowing down drivers citywide, because it’s essential to achieving the City of Roses’ ambitious goal of eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2025. As part of a separate effort, the city already won the right to slow to<a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2019/04/103789-portland-completes-massive-20-mph-speed-limit-overhaul"> 20 miles per hour in 2018,</a> and it’s continuing to redesign its roads to reinforce those limits as fast as possible.</p>
<p>If and when Portland’s application for local speed limit authority is approved, which Rivera is hopeful it will, that will give the city one more tool to save lives — and other states may want to consider adding it to their toolboxes, too.</p>
<p>“We think local control is really critical to helping us address the transportation safety needs of our community, given the needs of an urban enviroinment and how different they are from more rural and other environments,” Rivera added. “That authority, plus the ability to embrace a new paradigm that focuses on saving lives as the outcome — it’s critical to us achieving our goal of Vision Zero.”</p>
