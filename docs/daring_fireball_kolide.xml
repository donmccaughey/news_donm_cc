            <p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Right now, “Zero Trust” is in serious danger of
                becoming an empty buzzword. The problem isn’t just that marketers have slapped the Zero Trust label on
                everything short of breakfast cereal — it’s that for all the hype, <a
                        href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/the-biggest-data-breaches-and-leaks-of-2022">we
                    don’t seem to be getting any safer</a>.</p>

            <p>At the heart of Zero Trust is a good idea, but the way most companies execute that idea is
                <em>incomplete</em>. Specifically, most security practitioners forget that device compliance is a
                crucial element of Zero Trust. Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies
                that use Okta. Kolide’s premise is simple: if an employee’s device is out of compliance, they can’t log
                in to their cloud apps until they’ve fixed the problem. And instead of creating more work for IT, Kolide
                provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.</p>

            <p>Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, and Alex Mierjeski, reporting for ProPublica:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In 2008, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas decided to send his teenage grandnephew to Hidden Lake
                    Academy, a private boarding school in the foothills of northern Georgia. The boy, Mark Martin, was
                    far from home. For the previous decade, he had lived with the justice and his wife in the suburbs of
                    Washington, D.C. Thomas had taken legal custody of Martin when he was 6 years old and had recently
                    told an interviewer he was “raising him as a son.”</p>

                <p>Tuition at the boarding school ran more than $6,000 a month. But Thomas did not cover the bill. A
                    bank statement for the school from July 2009, buried in unrelated court filings, shows the source of
                    Martin’s tuition payment for that month: the company of billionaire real estate magnate Harlan Crow.
                    […]</p>

                <p>“You can’t be having secret financial arrangements,” said Mark W. Bennett, a retired federal judge
                    appointed by President Bill Clinton. Bennett said he was friendly with Thomas and declined to
                    comment for the record about the specifics of Thomas’ actions. But he said that when he was on the
                    bench, he wouldn’t let his lawyer friends buy him lunch. […]</p>

                <p>“This is way outside the norm. This is way in excess of anything I’ve seen,” said Richard Painter,
                    former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, referring to the cascade of
                    gifts over the years.</p>

                <p>Painter said that when he was at the White House, an official who’d taken what Thomas had would have
                    been fired: “This amount of undisclosed gifts? You’d want to get them out of the government.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Just breathtaking corruption. And Thomas’s response is basically, “Fuck you.”</p>

            <p>Yours truly and Ben Thompson’s podcast — two episodes per week, 15 minutes per episode. Not a minute
                less, not a minute more. If you’re not listening, you’re missing out. $5/month or $50/year. We’re now in
                our fourth year, and we’ve had remarkably little churn — people who subscribe to Dithering tend to stay
                subscribed, which warms my heart. It’s a fun show and everyone loves the enforced brevity and
                regularity.</p>

            <p>Bonus: At the end of March we started a Dithering group in <a
                    href="https://wavelength.app/">Wavelength</a>, the new private group messaging app <a
                    href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength">I started advising earlier this year</a>. It’s
                sort of an unofficial perk and an experiment. Subscribers can find the link to join the group in the
                show notes for each episode. We had no idea how this group would go, but it’s been wild. As of this
                typing there are over 2,900 members, and activity every day across a wide range of threads. I believe
                it’s the single largest group on all of Wavelength. (I just tonight told the story there of the piece of
                shit 2021 Kia Sorento I was bamboozled by Hertz into renting for a road trip to Boston this week, to
                pick my son up at the end of the college year.) It’s a nice, smart, fun little community.</p>

            <p>Great 3-minute clip from Joanna Stern’s interview with Ford CEO Jim Farley at the WSJ’s Future of
                Everything Festival. She asks him about GM’s plan to drop CarPlay from their future EVs, and Farley
                starts by saying “Yeah, how about that?” and laughing.</p>

            <p>Farley says, “The interior has to be really well done. But in terms of content? We kind of lost that
                battle 10 years ago. So get real with it, because you’re not going to make a ton of money on content
                inside the vehicle. It’s going to be safety/security, partial autonomy, and productivity in our eyes.
                [...] 70 percent of our Ford customers in the U.S are Apple customers. Why would I go to an Apple
                customer and say ‘Good luck!’? That doesn’t seem customer centric.”</p>

            <p>Farley and Ford have it exactly right. New car buyers, even from mainstream brands like Ford, are
                overwhelmingly iPhone users — exactly <a
                        href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156741/ios-16-carplay-apple-wwdc-hvac-deeper-integration">as
                    Apple bragged at WWDC last June</a>, and what iPhone users want in their cars is CarPlay. If
                anything, Farley is being kind to GM and GM CEO Mary Barra when he says their message to iPhone users is
                “Good luck” — it’s really more like “Fuck you.” And again, the most telling part of the whole exchange
                is the way Farley laughs at the start. You really have to hear it — his laugh implies a certain <em>I
                    can’t believe our good fortune that GM is doing this.</em> It’s enough to make you think Mary Barra
                is a mole from Ford, planted to steer would-be Chevy buyers into Ford dealerships.</p>

            <p>If you’re asking how it can be that 70 percent of Ford’s customers are iPhone users when the iPhone has
                maybe just over 50 percent market share in the U.S., the key is <em>new</em> car buyers. The Android
                masses are buying used cars, either because they don’t have the budget for a new car or because they
                don’t care about buying nice things (or both). So even a non-luxury brand like Ford has an overwhelming
                majority of customers with iPhones.</p>

            <p>Richard Sandomir, writing for The New York Times:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Katie Cotton, who as Apple’s longtime communications chief guarded
                    the media’s access to Steve Jobs, the company’s visionary
                    co-founder, and helped organize the introduction of many of his
                    products, died on April 6 in Redwood City, Calif. She was 57.</p>

                <p>Her death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Michael Mimeles, her
                    former husband. He did not give a cause but said that she had
                    experienced complications from heart surgery she underwent a few
                    years ago.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Not sure what took a month, but it’s a nice obituary, with quotes from Walt Mossberg, John Markoff, and
                other writers who covered Apple.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“She was formidable and tough and very protective of both Apple’s
                    brand and Steve, particularly when he got sick,” Walt Mossberg, a
                    former technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal, said in a
                    phone interview, referring to Mr. Jobs’s diagnosis of pancreatic
                    cancer in 2004. He added: “She was one of the few people he
                    trusted implicitly. He listened to her. She could pull him back
                    from something he intended to do or say.” Mr. Jobs died in 2011 at
                    56. [...]</p>

                <p>“When Steve came back, he didn’t just put key engineers in place,”
                    Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing, said.
                    “He put the right people in place to lead us around the company,
                    and Katie was a big part of that.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Cotton retired from Apple almost a decade ago, but Apple’s comms still bear her mark. She built a team
                and a culture.</p>

            <p>Rebecca Rubin, reporting for Variety:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> is officially the first film of
                    the year to cross the coveted $1 billion milestone at the global
                    box office.</p>

                <p>As of Sunday, after 26 days of release, the animated video game
                    adaptation, from Universal, Illumination and Nintendo, has grossed
                    $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally.
                    It’s only the fifth movie of pandemic times to join the $1 billion
                    club, following <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>,
                    <em>Jurassic World Dominion</em> and <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I realize box office numbers like this aren’t inflation-adjusted, but it’s rather incredible — no pun
                intended — that <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> has grossed far more than <a
                        href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/brand/bn3530750466/?ref_=bo_bns_table_4">any movie from
                    Pixar</a> (whose list is topped by <em>The Incredibles 2</em> at $600 million). This is no ding
                against Pixar, but simply speaks to how valuable and beloved the Nintendo character franchise is
                worldwide.</p>

            <p>What a coup it is for Universal to score <a
                    href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/super-nintendo-world-at-universal-studios-hollywood-is-officially-open-so-lets-a-go/">this
                partnership with Nintendo for their theme parks</a>. When comparing Universal’s parks to Disney’s, the
                gaping hole has always been Disney’s menagerie of beloved characters for kids — Mickey and friends, and
                an ever-growing list of new characters from new movies (including Pixar’s recent rich library).
                Universal had jack squat<sup>*</sup> for toddlers and grade schoolers. Now, they have Super Nintendo
                World, which like Pixar’s stuff appeals just as much to adults as it does toddlers.</p>

            <p><small>* In Orlando, Universal’s Islands of Adventure park has <a
                    href="https://orlandoinformer.com/universal/islands-of-adventure-seuss-landing/">Seuss Landing</a>,
                but as much as I adore Seuss’s books, his characters don’t have anything close to the sort of appeal
                Disney’s and Nintendo’s do. Part of Seuss’s appeal is that his style is slightly creepy. And Universal
                has let that whole Seuss Landing get sun-bleached over time — it’s looked disregarded, if not almost
                abandoned, for years.</small></p>

            <p>Off the top of my head, my single biggest complaint about Apple today is their role profiting from, and
                promoting, addictive pay-to-win games in the App Store. Yet simultaneously they’re building up an
                impressive, wide-ranging library of games that never have any in-app purchases at all with Apple Arcade.
                For $5/month, Apple Arcade has gone from “a pretty good deal” to “a veritable bargain”.</p>

            <p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Brydge, a once thriving startup making popular keyboard
                    accessories for iPad, Mac, and Microsoft Surface products, is
                    ceasing operations. According to nearly a dozen former Brydge
                    employees who spoke to <em>9to5Mac</em> , Brydge has gone through
                    multiple rounds of layoffs within the past year after at least two
                    failed acquisitions.</p>

                <p>As it stands today, Brydge employees have not been paid salaries
                    since January. Customers who pre-ordered the company’s most recent
                    product have been left in the dark since then as well. Its website
                    went <a href="https://www.brydge.com/">completely offline</a> earlier this year, and its social
                    media accounts have been silent since then as well.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The whole report is a hell of a read. Impressive original reporting from Miller and his colleagues at
                9to5Mac. Here’s just one gut punch among many in the story:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In December, Brydge held its annual Christmas party at a local
                    restaurant. [Co-CEOs] Mander-Jones and Smith had set a budget for the party,
                    the people said, and they stuck to that budget. At the end of the
                    night, one of the CEOs put his card down for the bill. His card
                    was declined, and a Brydge employee paid the bill instead, the
                    people said.</p>

            <p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Workers at Apple Inc.’s unionized store in Maryland are asking for
                    higher pay and additional time off, along with changes that could
                    affect the company’s tightly controlled retail experience, such as
                    letting customers tip employees.</p>

                <p>The employees, represented by the International Association of
                    Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, are conducting negotiations with
                    Apple on Wednesday and Thursday. Their latest proposal calls for
                    raises of as much as 10%, as well as major changes to the outlet’s
                    vacation policy, bereavement leave and overtime. [...]</p>

                <p>The workers’ negotiators also want Apple to adopt a tipping
                    system, letting patrons offer gratuities in increments of 3%, 5%
                    or a custom amount for in-store credit-card transactions.</p>

                <p>“This will allow thankful patrons the ability to express gratitude
                    for a job well done without any obligations,” the union wrote
                    Apple. “All monies collected through this manner would be
                    dispersed to members of the bargaining unit biweekly based on any
                    hours worked.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Higher pay and better vacation/holiday/leave policies are exactly the sort of things the union should ask
                for.</p>

            <p>But this tipping proposal is so antithetical to Apple’s customer-first retail experience that it feels
                like a joke, or that the union negotiators have never even been in an Apple Store. They might as well
                ask for employees to be allowed to vape while working. Asking for something like tipping — on very
                expensive products, no less — plays right into the hands of those who argue that retail store
                unionization is not aligned with the interests of customers.</p>

            <p>Stores that pay employees by commission create an obvious incentive for salespeople to pressure customers
                into purchasing items they don’t need or aren’t entirely comfortable with. Prompting for tips on retail
                sales is just a backdoor commission.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/">announced
                    its latest quarterly results</a> on Thursday.
                    The company posted $94.8 billion in revenue, down slightly from
                    the year-ago quarter but — at least to my eyes — not down as
                    much as we might have expected.</p>

                <p>Mac revenue was, as expected, down 31 percent to $7.2 billion — the lowest quarter of Mac revenue
                    since 2020. iPad was down 13
                    percent to $6.7 billion, the lowest iPad revenue quarter since
                    2020. iPhone was up 2 percent to $51.3 billion, which given the
                    downward trend elsewhere was pretty impressive — it was a Q2
                    record for iPhone revenue.</p>

                <p>Services revenue soared to an all-time record of $20.9 billion, up
                    5 percent. Wearables was down by one percent, to $8.8 billion.</p>

                Colors’s transcript</a> of Tim Cook’s prepared statement and Apple’s Q&amp;A with analysts. I thought it
                was interesting which shows and movies from TV+ Cook chose to highlight:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series
                    like “Shrinking” and “The Big Door Prize” and got to welcome “Ted
                    Lasso” back into their homes for a third season. Movies like
                    “Tetris” are captivating viewers with many more to come, including
                    Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” later this year.</p>

                <p>Three years since its launch, Apple TV+ programming has been
                    celebrated across the globe with over 1,450 nominations and more
                    than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on “The Boy,
                    The Mole, The Fox, and The Horse,” which won an Academy Award for
                    Best Animated Short Film.</p>

                <p>This season of our historic 10-year partnership with Major League
                    Soccer is well underway. With MLS Season Pass, we’ve created the
                    ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the
                    ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball
                    season in full swing, Apple TV+ subscribers can watch their
                    favorite teams with a return of Friday Night Baseball.</p>

            <p>Bobby Allyn, reporting for NPR:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In an unprompted Tuesday email, Musk wrote: “So is NPR going to
                    start posting on Twitter again, or should we reassign @NPR to
                    another company?”</p>

                <p>Under Twitter’s terms of service, an account’s inactivity is based
                    on logging in, not tweeting. Those rules state that an account
                    must be logged into at least every 30 days, and that “prolonged
                    inactivity” can result in it being permanently removed.</p>

                <p>Musk did not answer when asked whether he planned to change the
                    platform’s definition of inactivity and he declined to say what
                    prompted his new questions about NPR’s lack of participation on
                    Twitter.</p>

                <p>“Our policy is to recycle handles that are definitively dormant,”
                    Musk wrote in another email. “Same policy applies to all accounts.
                    No special treatment for NPR.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is a shakedown, pure and simple. What a message to big brands and celebrities: stop posting to
                Twitter and they’ll reassign your longstanding username.</p>

            <p>It’s bizarre that Musk thinks this might prompt NPR to start posting to Twitter again, when the only
                rational reaction is to feel assured that walking away from Twitter was the right move.</p>

            <p>The Onion:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Emphasizing the negative effects the recent union action would
                    have on the company, Netflix officials condemned the Writers Guild
                    of America strike Tuesday for putting future show cancellations
                    behind schedule. “We have dozens of shows already stuck in the
                    early stages of the preproduction process, but this strike will
                    cause significant delays in our eventual scrapping of those

                    preventing work that writers had committed over a year of their
                    lives to from becoming fully realized creations that the streaming
                    platform could kill before they ever saw the light of day was
                    unconscionable.</p>

            <p>Hursh Agrawal, cofounder of The Browser Company (makers of the upstart browser <a
                    href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a>, which for now is Mac-only):</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>We’re sprinting hard to get Arc onto Windows in 2023 — exact timing still 🤐!</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>His tweet has a two-minute video that outlines a tremendously ambitious plan:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Swift on Windows (compiler, debugger)</li>
                <li>VSCode integration, Swift bindings for WinAppSDK</li>
                <li>Porting Arc to Windows</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If they pull it off, they’ll ship a toolchain to develop cross-platform Mac/Windows apps, programmed in
                Swift using VSCode. I have my doubts about whether this is possible from a small team, and I have
                different doubts about whether this would be a good way to write good Mac apps. So I’d ignore this for
                now — <em>but</em> for the fact that Arc itself is very interesting, and very much real.</p>

            <p>It’s not for me, but it really has a bunch of innovative, original ideas for a web browser. They’ve
                proven that they can ship. So I say godspeed.</p>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jbenton/status/1653394051889082368">Joshua Benton on Twitter</a>, linking to
                <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america#monthly-202201-202303">Statcounter’s
                    U.S. browser share data for March</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>For the first time ever, Safari has more than 20% of desktop
                    browser share in the U.S.</p>

                <p>Since last June, Chrome is down 6% (61.35% to 55.28%), while
                    Safari is up by a similar amount (15.58% to 22.3%).</p>

                <p>Seems driven entirely by increased Mac market share. Over the same
                    span, Windows is down 14% (67.57% to 53.43%) and macOS is up 6%
                    (24.27% to 31.34%). ChromeOS went from 3.75% to 8.47% (though
                    the school year makes that comp a bit unfair).</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202201-202303">Statcounter’s
                latest <em>global</em> numbers</a>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chrome: 66.1%</li>
                <li>Safari: 11.9%</li>
                <li>Edge: 11%</li>
                <li>Firefox: 5.7%</li>
                <li>Opera: 3.1%</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Looking at the <a
                    href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202201-202303">global
                chart</a>, Chrome seems to be holding steady in the desktop market over the last year, but Safari does
                show an uptick from about 9.5 to just under 11 percent. As Benton points out, the most striking thing in
                Statcounter’s report is the decline in Windows’s desktop OS share over the last year, both <a
                        href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">globally</a>
                and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">in the
                    U.S.</a> I suspect Windows is losing share to <em>mobile</em> browsing just as much or more so than
                it is to MacOS and ChromeOS. Back when Windows had over 90 percent market share, a huge chunk of that
                was people who didn’t really choose a Windows PC because of Windows, but who just wanted a “computer”.
                They took the default, and the default computer ran Windows.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, Windows still gets most of the default <em>desktop</em> market (although it seem ChromeOS
                continues to eat into that, especially in K-12 education). But for more and more people, their default
                “computer” is their phone. They might have a PC, but they use it less and less.</p>

            <p>Which brings me to another real eye-opener: Statcounter’s OS market share numbers — across all devices,
                desktop and mobile — from 2009 until now.</p>

            <p>Globally, Windows was surpassed by Android back in 2017. The decline in Windows’s dominance has been
                precipitous: in 2009 Statcounter pegged its share at 95 percent; today it’s 28 percent. In the U.S.,
                Windows is effectively neck-and-neck with iOS, each hovering around 30 percent for the last few years.
                It doesn’t seem outlandish to project that Mac and iOS, combined, might soon surpass Windows and Android
                combined in Statcounter’s share numbers for the U.S.</p>

            <p>The Mac, on the other hand, is clearly seeing impressive market share growth. We all kind of knew this
                was true from the Mac revenue numbers <a href="https://sixcolors.com/tag/quarterly/">Apple reports each
                    quarter</a>, but Statcounter’s data backs up Apple’s claims that the Mac continues to gain new
                users. And that in turn leads to more desktop Safari users — even though recent switchers strike me as
                among the most likely Mac users to use Chrome, which they’re likely familiar with. But if desktop Safari
                usage share is growing, it must mean Mac usage is growing.</p>

            <p>The rise of iOS and Android as humanity’s primary computing platforms has obliterated Windows’s
                decades-long hegemony. To be fair, when your usage share was at one time 95 percent <em>of all web
                    browsing</em>, there’s nowhere to go but down. But today, Windows is just one of four major
                platforms — and is the only one of the four that is in obvious decline, both in usage and relevance. The
                Mac, on the other hand, has seemingly been <em>bolstered</em> by the rise of the iPhone. We talked a lot
                about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2007/10/milhouse">the “halo effect” of the iPod</a> on Mac
                sales in the mid-2000s, but it’s more true today with the iPhone and iPad. Mac unit sales are up and its
                share of desktop computing is <em>way</em> up. People who don’t care about desktop computing are just
                using their phones and tablets for everything; people who do care are more likely than ever to be using
                a Mac.</p>

            <p>One more nugget, just for kicks — <a
                    href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america#monthly-202201-202303">U.S.</a>
                and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">worldwide</a>
                numbers for iOS and Android in the mobile market:</p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>U.S.</th>
                    <th>Global</th>
                </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>iOS</td>
                    <td>60</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Android</td>
                    <td>40</td>
                    <td>69</td>
                </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>It’s also worth noting on the charts above that in hindsight, it wasn’t clear that mobile browsing would
                surpass desktop browsing until 2013 or 2014 — six or seven years after the debut of the iPhone. That’s a
                timeframe worth keeping in mind for — oh, just to pick a random up-and-coming product category — AR/VR
                headsets. The iPhone did change everything, but it took a while to show it outside the
                enthusiast / early-adopter market.</p>

            <p>I knew that iOS 16 introduced support for custom domain names for iCloud+ Mail — bring your own domain
                name but use iCloud as your email provider and web interface. Here’s a thing I only learned today
                though: you can register <em>new</em> domain names right in iOS 16’s Settings app: iCloud Account →
                iCloud → iCloud Mail → Custom Email Domain.</p>

            <p>In their support document, Apple states:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>A third-party registrar handles the sale of each domain. For
                    billing or refund issues, contact them for support.</p>

                that’s Cloudflare (whose caching and SSL services I use for Daring Fireball — fantastic company). Not
                sure if that’s true worldwide, or if Apple has other registrar partners in other countries.</p>

            <p>Right now, “Zero Trust” is in serious danger of becoming an empty buzzword. The problem isn’t just that
                marketers have slapped the Zero Trust label on everything short of breakfast cereal — it’s that for all
                the hype, <a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/the-biggest-data-breaches-and-leaks-of-2022">we
                    don’t seem to be getting any safer</a>.</p>

            <p>At the heart of Zero Trust is a good idea, but the way most companies execute that idea is
                <em>incomplete</em>. Specifically, most security practitioners forget that device compliance is a
                crucial element of Zero Trust.</p>

            <p>Think about it: your identity provider can ensure that only <em>known</em> devices access your company’s
                apps, but just because you recognize a device, doesn’t mean it’s in a secure state. A malware-infected
                laptop running an outdated OS can’t exactly be “trusted.” And you can’t count on MDMs to achieve total
                compliance. Things like <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3HNQBX5">unencrypted access credentials</a> are out
                of their reach, not to mention <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3YinMcq">Linux devices writ large</a>. </p>

            <p>Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies that use Okta.</p>

            <p><em>Our premise is simple: if an employee’s device is out of compliance, it can’t access your apps.</em>
            </p>

            <p>Kolide’s unique approach works with Okta to make device compliance part of the authentication process. If
                a device isn’t compliant, users can’t log in to their cloud apps until they’ve fixed the problem. And
                instead of creating more work for IT, <a
                        href="https://daringfireball.net/martini/images/kolide-device-blocked.png">Kolide provides
                    instructions so users can get unblocked on their own</a>.</p>

            <p>Kolide works across your Mac, Windows, and even Linux devices, with mobile support coming soon. Our
                lightweight agent complements your existing tools, brings a lot of compliance issues into scope and
                under control, and can complete your Zero Trust picture.</p>

            <p>NYPD chief Jeffrey Maddrey, on Twitter:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The 21st century calls for 21st century policing. AirTags in
                    your car will help us recover your vehicle if it’s stolen. We’ll
                    use our drones, our StarChase technology and good old fashion
                    police work to safely recover your stolen car. Help us help you,
                    get an AirTag.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/nypd-encourages-car-owners-to-use-airtags/">Juli Clover, at
                MacRumors</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw72THyXsQ">press conference on
                    Sunday</a>, New York
                    City mayor Eric Adams said that the city will provide 500 free
                    AirTags to car owners. According to <em><a
                            href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/watch-mayor-adams-makes-public-safety-announcement-in-the-bronx/">CBS
                        News</a></em> , the
                    AirTags are available to residents in Castle Hill, Soundview, and
                    Parkchester, as these areas have seen a 548 percent increase in
                    stolen Hyundai and Kia vehicles.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is a case where, ideally, you’d want FindMy (or <a
                    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Apple’s
                Tracker Detect app</a> for Android) <em>not</em> to notify a potential thief that they’re being tracked
                by an unknown-to-them AirTag. But we can’t have it both ways. There’s no magic way to mark <em>your</em>
                AirTag as not being used for stalking.</p>

            <p>One spitball idea: Apple could license AirTag technology to be built into third-party products. With
                cars, they could make it part of the CarPlay system — have an AirTag integrated with the dashboard
                console system.</p>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong> I forgot that Apple <em>does</em> license FindMy this way: <a
                    href="https://support.vanmoof.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002192135-how-do-i-connect-my-bike-with-the-apple-find-my-network-">VanMoof
                e-bikes have FindMy support</a>. I was reminded of this today by a DF reader who found his stolen bike
                this week using it.</p>

            <p>Juli Clover, reporting for MacRumors:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Apple today released Rapid Security Response (RSR) updates that
                    are available for iPhone and iPad users running the iOS 16.4.1
                    update and Mac users running macOS 13.3.1. These are the first
                    public RSR updates that Apple has released to date. [...]</p>

                <p>iOS Security Response 16.4.1 is available through the standard
                    Software Update mechanism in the iPhone or iPad Settings app, but
                    is a quick update, requiring just a couple of minutes to download
                    the update and then a quick restart for the install process. The
                    macOS update can be installed through System Settings.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I’ve seen a few of these RSR updates while running beta versions of iOS, but I suspect those were all
                just tests from Apple of the RSR delivery and update mechanisms. It’s a great new mechanism for Apple,
                but one that they’d only use for truly significant bugs — ones they realize are being actively exploited
                in the wild, or could be to deeply detrimental effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong> Seems a little weird that today’s RSR updates aren’t listed yet on <a
                    href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">Apple’s security updates page</a>. In recent years
                Apple has been very diligent about updating this page upon the release of security updates. These new
                RSR updates seem to exist outside this documentation system for now.</p>

            <p>From the official blog of Jetpack, an official WordPress plugin from Automattic:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922">Twitter decided</a>, on short
                    notice, to dramatically change
                    the terms and pricing of the Twitter API. We have attempted to
                    work with Twitter in good faith to negotiate new terms, but we
                    have not been able to reach an agreement. As a result, the Twitter
                    connection on Jetpack Social will cease to work, and your blog
                    posts will no longer be auto-shared to Twitter.</p>

                <p>You will still be able to share your posts to Twitter manually by
                    pasting the post link into the body of your tweet.</p>

                <p>In addition, you can still auto-share your posts to Tumblr,
                    Facebook, and Linkedin. In the near future, we are adding the
                    ability to auto-share to Instagram and Mastodon.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Twitter’s new API pricing is exorbitant, <a
                    href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-elon-musk-paid-enterprise-api-access-pricing">starting at
                $42,000/month for 50 million tweets</a>. I get the feeling that there are a lot of “enterprise” Twitter
                API users whom Elon Musk believed would definitely pay these prices, who instead are saying “<em>We are
                    definitely</em> not <em>paying these prices</em>.” Musk thinks Twitter is indispensable. Doesn’t
                seem like almost anyone else does.</p>

            <p>This is a perfect case: Twitter was getting far more value out of Wordpress blogs being able to
                auto-share new posts than vice-versa. Now those tweets just won’t go out.</p>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong> Here’s another good example: <a
                    href="https://www.engadget.com/nycs-transport-authority-will-no-longer-post-service-alerts-on-twitter-051701441.html">the
                MTA (New York’s transit authority) will no longer post status updates</a> to Twitter. If they’re not
                paying, who is?</p>

        <summary type="text">This situation I ran into — seeing a promotion for a three-month Apple Arcade trial despite
            the fact that I pay for Apple One (which includes Arcade) — is a glitch that only happened for some people
            who, like me, have split Apple IDs: one for iTunes and another for iCloud.

            <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/ios_adware">Yours truly, two weeks ago</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>For the last several weeks, I’ve noticed <a
                        href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/ios-settings-arcade-ad.png">an ad in Settings on
                    my
                    iPhone</a>, in the iCloud section at the very top of the first
                    screen: “Apple Arcade Free for 3 Months”. The reason this is dumb
                    is that I pay for a family account for Apple One, <em>so we already
                        have Apple Arcade</em>. But here’s Apple badgering me to sign up for a
                    3-month free trial that I don’t need.</p>

                <p>If I tap into that ad’s section in Settings it explains why
                    they’re offering it: “Services Included With Purchase”. I’m not
                    even sure what device I bought that earned me this offer, but it
                    shouldn’t matter. Why are they showing me something I already
                    pay for?</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This prompted some give-and-take with, well, <em>people familiar with the matter</em>, and I have an
                answer to share. The problem I was running into was a bug that resulted from the fact I have
                <em>split</em> Apple ID accounts: one account for iTunes and App Store purchases, and a separate account
                for my Apple ID. Long story short:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>I created my mac.com iCloud account back in January 2000, <a
                        href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Mac.com">when Apple launched the service under the name
                    iTools</a>. That same service was soon renamed .Mac, then MobileMe (and Apple <a
                        href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201771">changed the domain name to me.com</a>), then,
                    finally, iCloud (and icloud.com).</p></li>
                <li><p>When I signed up for my iTunes account <a
                        href="https://www.macworld.com/article/227143/15-years-of-itunes-a-look-at-apples-media-app-and-its-influence-on-an-industry.html">when
                    the iTunes Music Store launched back in April 2003</a>, I used my primary @daringfireball.net
                    address, not my @mac.com address. I don’t recall why I did this exactly, but I <em>think</em> that
                    what I was thinking was something along the lines of “<em>I’m still not sure about this whole .Mac
                        thing, but I’m pretty sure I’ll have my daringfireball.net address forever.</em>”</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>In hindsight, this was a mistake on my part. Everything is simpler if you only have one Apple ID that you
                use for both iCloud and iTunes/App Store purchases. The reason I never switched to using my mac.com
                iCloud account for everything, including purchases, is that there’s never been a way to migrate old
                purchases from a different account. And I’ve bought a lot of music, movies, and apps over the years
                using my other account.<sup id="fnr1-2023-05-01"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-01">1</a></sup></p>

            <p>Using split accounts has always been a bit weird, occasionally problematic and/or confusing — but has
                mostly just worked out. It helps quite a bit that there are a <em>lot</em> of people working at Apple in
                the same situation. By the time the iPhone became a hit product, users new to the Apple ecosystem
                naturally used one address for everything. But split accounts are common from long-time Mac users, and
                there are a lot of long-time Mac users inside Apple.</p>

            <p>This situation I ran into — seeing a promotion for a three-month Apple Arcade trial despite the fact that
                I pay for Apple One (which includes Arcade) — is just one of those glitches. Most Apple One subscribers
                don’t have split accounts, so they never saw the unnecessary promotion. And even amongst those who <em>do</em>
                have split accounts, they’d have to run into a certain set of circumstances to make it appear.<sup
                        id="fnr2-2023-05-01"><a href="#fn2-2023-05-01">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>So, it was a bug. And I am reliably informed that a fix is in the works that will appear in a near-future
                update to iOS.</p>

                        <p>One way that it’s confusing to have multiple Apple IDs is that it’s my iCloud account — my
                            mac.com address — that serves as the primary account for family sharing with my wife and
                            son. But it’s my other account — my daringfireball.net address — that has made all my iTunes
                            and App Store purchases for 23 years. That includes making the purchase to subscribe to
                            Apple One, even though Apple One includes features like additional iCloud storage space that
                            apply to my iCloud account. So even though I have two accounts, one for iCloud and one for
                            purchases, Apple’s back end is somehow capable of making it all work. They are two different
                            accounts, but my iTunes account purchases can be shared through my iCloud account’s family
                            sharing. It sounds confusing, I know. But for the last decade or so, it really has <em>just

            <p>My thanks to Atoms for sponsoring last week to promote their sweet new sneakers: a limited edition
                collaboration with Marques Brownlee. The mid-top Model 251 sneaker features a sleek design that blends
                style and comfort, paying homage to Marques’s first YouTube video — 2m:51s long — and the start of his
                journey as a creator. </p>

            <p>They hooked me up with a pair and they are <em>nice</em>. (Where’s that chef’s kiss emoji?) Same great
                fit and comfort as regular Atoms, with a very distinct look. I don’t even need to tell you the colors.
                Available only until May 23 — check them out while they’re available.</p>

            <p>The Pixelmator blog:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>A new update for Photomator is now available, bringing a ton of
                    fantastic new features, changes, and improvements. But hold on,
                    did we say Photomator? That’s right — the app now has a snappier
                    and catchier new name! To complete the makeover, version 2.3 also
                    features a beautiful, refreshed design, but the biggest highlight
                    of this update lies beyond the looks.</p>

                <p>We’re excited to introduce an all-new and incredibly powerful
                    selective adjustments feature that will completely change the way
                    you edit photos in Photomator. From now on, you can easily select
                    and edit specific areas of a photo using a variety of selections
                    and masks, and even make selections automatically, using AI. There
                    are just so many great new features in this update, so read along
                    if you’d like to learn all about them, and stick around till the
                    end for one more, very exciting announcement.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Just a terrific app that presses the boundaries of how good an iOS app can be.</p>

            <p>Brian Sozzi, reporting for Yahoo Finance:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>GM told investors on Tuesday it’s looking to achieve profit
                    margins of more than 20% on “new businesses” by 2030. That
                    would be above the company’s overall 2030 operating margin goal
                    of 12% to 14%.</p>

                <p>Pros have speculated GM could charge subscriptions for services
                    such as insurance by tapping into an accumulating stream of data
                    that it owns.</p>

                <p>“It’s part of where we’re going as a company,” Jacobson added.
                    “Obviously data and software is a big competitive space across
                    the board.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The more I read about GM’s thinking, the more alarming it seems. It doesn’t seem to be about being able
                to provide a better experience than CarPlay, but instead about collecting surveillance data that Apple’s
                privacy rules don’t allow. Sozzi just breezes past this notion of using surveillance data to sell car
                insurance, but a car that reports such data to insurance companies seems like a privacy disaster. My
                insurance company doesn’t need to know how fast I drive, or where I go and when.</p>

            <p>Rest of World:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>It’s been exactly six months since Elon Musk took over Twitter,
                    promising a new era of free speech and independence from political
                    bias. But Twitter’s self-reported data shows that, under Musk, the
                    company has complied with hundreds more government orders for
                    censorship or surveillance — especially in countries such as
                    Turkey and India.</p>

                <p>The data, drawn from Twitter’s reports to the Lumen database,
                    shows that between October 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023, Twitter
                    received a total of 971 requests from governments and courts.
                    These requests included orders to remove controversial posts, as
                    well as demands that Twitter produce private data to identify
                    anonymous accounts. Twitter reported that it fully complied in 808
                    of those requests, and partially complied in 154 other cases. (For
                    nine requests, it did not report any specific response.)</p>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                <p>This isn’t a transparency report. It’s an obfuscation report. And,
                    if Elon is correct that “transparency is the key to trust,” this
                    report suggests you shouldn’t trust Twitter one bit.</p>

            <p>Kit Chellel, in an enthralling piece for Bloomberg:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I spent six months investigating the clandestine world of
                    professional roulette players to find out who Tosa is and how he
                    beat the system. The search took me deep into a secret war between
                    those who make a living betting on the wheel and those who try to
                    stop them — and ultimately to an encounter with Tosa himself. The
                    British press got plenty wrong in their reports about what
                    happened on the night of March 15, 2004. There was no laser. But
                    the newspapers were right about one thing: It is possible to beat
                    roulette.</p>

                <p>An appeals court on Monday mostly sided with Apple over its App
                    Store rules in a suit with Epic Games. The decision signals that
                    Apple’s control over the App Store and the fees it charges likely
                    won’t significantly change as a result of an ongoing legal
                    challenge by Epic Games.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Long story short, Epic has been barking up the wrong tree.</p>

                    is now swarmed by climate-denying trolls, bots, and idiots because
                    science, data, and facts scare the hell out of them, and because
                    Elon’s Twitter now promotes them. What a cesspool. Example:</p>

            <p>I think there’s a line of thought that Elon Musk had months ago ruined Twitter, but the last few days
                have shown that it’s gotten far worse than ever before. The main buyers of Twitter Blue are, indeed,
                “trolls, bots, and idiots”, and Twitter is now hardwired to prioritize tweets and replies from those
                accounts.</p>

            <p>The blue-check accounts now are just Catturd, people who want to be Catturd, and million-plus-follower
                users <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1649147510525423626">who sure as shit are

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/MIT/status/1649963039184113666">Here’s a tweet from MIT’s official
                account</a> that simply states a fact: “We did not subscribe to Twitter Blue.” Look at the replies.
                They’re all blue-check MAGA-hats.</p>

            <p>Michael M. Grynbaum, John Koblin, and Benjamin Mullin, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“CNN and Don have parted ways,” Chris Licht, CNN’s chairman, said
                    in a statement. “Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and
                    we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish
                    him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.”</p>

                <p>That benign language contrasted sharply with Mr. Lemon’s
                    interpretation of the day’s events. In a scathing message on
                    Twitter, Mr. Lemon told viewers that he was abruptly informed by
                    his talent agent “that I have been terminated by CNN.”</p>

                <p>“I am stunned,” Mr. Lemon wrote. “After 17 years at CNN I would
                    have thought that someone in management would have had the decency
                    to tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication
                    that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved
                    at the network.” (CNN disputed Mr. Lemon’s account, saying the
                    anchor “was offered an opportunity to meet with management but
                    instead released a statement on Twitter.”)</p>

                <p>In a clear sign of acrimony, Mr. Lemon has retained the aggressive
                    Hollywood litigator Bryan Freedman to handle his exit. His
                    contract with CNN runs through 2026, according to two people with
                    direct knowledge of his deal.</p>

            <p>The New York Times:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Fox News said Monday that it was parting ways with Tucker
                    Carlson, its most popular prime time host who was also the
                    source of repeated controversies and headaches for the network
                    because of his statements on everything from race relations to
                    L.G.B.T.Q. rights.</p>

                <p>The network made the announcement less than a week after it agreed
                    to pay $787.5 million in a defamation lawsuit in which Mr.
                    Carlson’s show, one of the highest rated on Fox, figured
                    prominently for its role in spreading misinformation after the
                    2020 election.</p>

                <p>In making its announcement, Fox <a
                        href="https://press.foxnews.com/2023/04/fox-news-media-and-tucker-carlson-part-ways">offered a
                    terse statement</a>
                    of gratitude. “Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to
                    part ways. We thank him for his service to the network as a host
                    and prior to that as a contributor,” it said.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1650525732819423234">Aaron Rupar</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Here was the end of what turned out to be Tucker Carlson’s final
                    Fox News show last Friday. Certainly no indication that he didn’t
                    expect to be on the air tonight. In fact Tucker’s final words are,
                    “We’ll be back on Monday.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1650533995036246016">Brian Stelter</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Let’s make one thing very clear: Tucker Carlson did not choose to
                    leave Fox News like this. Others can decide whether the word
                    “fired” applies here, but he isn’t leaving on his own terms.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It seems like it’s unlikely to be a complete coincidence that Fox News settled the Dominion lawsuit for
                nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, but odious though Carlson may be, he wasn’t really at the
                forefront of Fox’s election lies. <a
                        href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-09/fox-news-anchor-maria-bartiromo-dominion-defamation-suit-murdoch-trump-election-2020-carlson">Maria
                    Bartiromo</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/judge-in-dominions-defamation-case-suggests-fox-news-has-a-lou-dobbs-problem">Lou
                    Dobbs</a> were — and they’re both still employed at Fox.</p>

            <p>Some people are speculating that it might be acquiescence to The Boss in Mar-a-Lago, after text messages
                uncovered in the Dominion suit revealed Carlson writing to colleagues, of Trump, “<a
                        href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/carlson-on-trump">I hate him passionately</a>.”
                But if Trump had a grudge against Carlson, why did he do an interview on Carlson’s show just two weeks
                ago?</p>

            <p>Makes me think something else is going on. Maybe some sort of harassment situation? Or maybe the Murdochs
                figured <em>someone</em> had to be fired, and it might as well be the guy who’s too big for his
                britches?</p>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong> The LA Times:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>People familiar with the situation who were not authorized to
                    comment publicly said the decision to fire Carlson came straight
                    from Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Carlson’s exit is related
                    to the <a
                            href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-27/fired-fox-news-producer-said-she-was-coached-by-network-lawyers-on-defamation-case-testimony">discrimination
                        lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg</a>,
                    the producer fired by the network last month, the people said.
                    Carlson’s senior executive producer Justin Wells has also been
                    terminated, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

                there’s only one opening left before the end of June: next week.</p>

            <p>Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling
                them <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">back in 2007</a>. They’ve succeeded, I
                think, because they make everyone happy. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always
                relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and
                hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing
                about them is how many sponsors <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">return for
                    subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p>

            <p>If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed
                with high quality and good design, <a
                        href="mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship">get in touch</a>. If this
                quarter is a sign, the summer months will start filling up soon. And as I mentioned above, if you’ve got
                something to promote right now, next week is the opening left this quarter.</p>

            <p>My thanks to Kolide for their continuing sponsorship support here at DF — they co-sponsored <a
                    href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/03/31/ep-371">the latest episode of The Talk
                Show</a> that dropped last night, and they sponsored this entire week here at the website. They’re a
                great company with a great product.</p>

            <p>Here’s an uncomfortable fact: at most companies, employees can download sensitive company data onto any
                device, keep it there forever, and never even know that they’re doing something wrong. Kolide’s new
                report, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3I7025A">The State of Sensitive Data</a>, addresses this issue
                head-on.</p>

            <p>Kolide offers a more nuanced approach than MDM solutions to setting and enforcing sensitive data
                policies. Their premise is simple: if an employee’s device is out of compliance, it can’t access your
                apps. Kolide lets admins run queries to detect sensitive data, flag devices that have violated policies,
                and enforce OS and browser updates so vulnerable devices aren’t accessing data.</p>

        <summary type="text">Anything that attempts to establish a post-phone beachhead has to do the things we love to

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
            <p>Raymond Wong, reporting for Inverse, “<a
                    href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-wearable-camera-sensor-projector-video-demo">Watch
                Humane’s Wearable AI Projector in Action</a>”:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Humane, the top-secret tech startup founded by <a
                        href="https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/the-ipads-original-software-designer-and-program-lead-look-back-on-the-devices-first-10-years">ex-Apple
                    vets
                    Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno</a>, just showed off the
                    first demo for its projector-based wearable at a TED talk.
                    <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/21/humane-ai-powered-wearable">Axios’s Ina Fried broke the
                        news</a>, and Inverse has seen a
                    recording of the full TED talk given by Chaudhri.</p>

                <p>Journalist Zarif Ali, who had <a href="https://twitter.com/ZarifAli9/status/1649230439322664968">tweeted
                    out an image</a> of
                    Humane’s wearable projecting a phone call function onto Chaudhri’s
                    palm, says the full TED talk video is not slated to become
                    available until April 22.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>So the full video should be out tomorrow, but in the meantime, Wong has pulled a bunch of clips. There’s
                some cool technology being shown, including on-the-fly translation from English to French using an
                AI-trained version of Chaudhri’s own voice, but what I fundamentally don’t get about Humane is their
                anti-phone slant. Chaudhri emphasizes that you don’t need a phone to use the unnamed Humane device, but
                if the device can receive and place phone calls, and has a network connection, must not their device
                itself be ... a phone? Just a phone in a different form factor.</p>

            <p>Back in February when LeBron James broke the all-time NBA scoring title, <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1624041258778763265">Chaudhri retweeted someone</a>
                comparing a photo of James’s record-breaking shot (with a seeming majority of the fans in the background
                holding their phones to capture the moment — <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1624041258778763265">almost all of them
                    iPhones</a>, natch) with Michael Jordan’s iconic 1998 championship-winning shot against the Utah
                Jazz (with, of course, not a single fan with a phone in hand).<sup id="fnr1-2023-04-21"><a
                        href="#fn1-2023-04-21">1</a></sup> Chaudhri’s comment on the comparison: “we all deserve
                better.”</p>

            <p>The thought being, I surmise, that Chaudhri thinks something is wrong that so many of us turn to our
                phones to photograph or film major moments in our lives, rather than just enjoying them through our own
                senses. I get it to some degree. If I’d been at that Lakers game, my phone would’ve been in my pocket at
                that moment, not just to absorb the actual game experience, but because I know that no photo I could
                take could possibly be as as good as those being taken by courtside professional sports photographers.
                But those thousands of fans who did have their phones out for that moment weren’t thinking “<em>This
                    sucks, I wish I didn’t have to stare at my phone to capture this.</em>” They were thinking “<em>This
                    is awesome and I’m glad I can capture this.</em>”</p>

            <p>People take their own photos at major events not because they think those will be great photos, but
                because they’re proof that they were there. Selfies are the new autographs, and a shaky iPhone photo
                from the perspective of your own seat at the event is the new certificate of attendance.</p>

            <p>We still don’t know much about Humane’s device, as Wong’s colleague at Inverse <a
                    href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-wearable-ai-projector-apps-price">Ian Carlos Campbell
                notes in this follow-up piece</a>. But everything we do know seems positioned around the notion of
                relieving us of the burden of being tethered to our iPhones all day every day. The fundamental flaw in
                Humane’s entire premise, as I see it, is that people don’t feel burdened by their phones. People <em>love</em>
                them — especially iPhone owners. And those who are ambivalent or even downright antipathetic toward
                their phones surely aren’t the sort of people who are interested in a newfangled laser-projecting
                AI-driven chest-badge computer.</p>

            <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/25/season-of-the-witch">I wrote about this all the way
                back in 2010</a>, in the era of the iPhone 4, when Microsoft debuted a high-budget ad campaign for their
                answer to the iPhone, Windows Phone 7. The ads were very entertaining — <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg1gbVGk19k">particularly this one</a> — but the whole
                premise was fundamentally flawed. Microsoft’s message was that if you switched to Windows Phone you
                wouldn’t need to stare at your phone all the time. The problem is that people stare at their phones all
                the time not because they have to but <em>because they want to</em>.</p>

            <p>“<em>Finally, you can replace this thing that you despise</em>” is a powerful marketing message. “<em>Finally,
                you can replace this thing that you love</em>” is not.</p>

            <p>So far, it feels like Humane’s entire premise is founded on that same mistake: building a new device
                intended to replace our phones, without that new device being able to do any of the dozens of things we
                <em>love</em> to do on our phones that require a display. Apple Watch and AirPods thrive because they’re
                satellites to our iPhones, not ostensible replacements. Our iPhones aren’t a burden — they’re a
                pleasure. I’m not arguing there are no downsides to our collective mass addiction to our phones. There’s
                undeniably a nostalgic appeal to many aspects of the pre-iPhone age. But the notion of even a single
                trip to the grocery store without a phone to provide (unlimited!) material to read or watch while I wait
                at the checkout line seems like veritable torture to me now. Anything that attempts to establish a
                post-phone beachhead has to do the things we love to do with our phones, or entertain us in new ways
                that make us forget about them. I don’t see how a laser projector on a chest badge does that.</p>

                        <p>Not only are there no fans with cell phones in hand in the Jordan photo, there are none with
                            <em>any</em> sort of camera in hand. Cell phone cameras were uncommon in 1998, but regular
                            cameras were not. But before the iPhone age, when such policies became untenable, events
                            like concerts and indoor sporting events banned cameras. Same thing with casinos. And even
                            if the rules didn’t prohibit cameras, people just didn’t have the habit of taking their own
                            photographs. Today we don’t just take photos with our phones instead of with standalone
                            cameras — we take thousands of photos every year that we never would have taken in the first
                            place, because we wouldn’t have had a camera with us. The best camera really is the one you
                            have with you.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2023-04-21" class="footnoteBackLink"

            <p>Ben Smith, writing at Semafor:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>My old boss and partner Jonah Peretti announced today that he’s
                    shutting down BuzzFeed News, which we built together starting
                    in 2012.</p>

                <p>He wrote to staff that he’d been ​​”slow to accept that the big
                    platforms wouldn’t provide the distribution or financial support
                    required to support premium-free journalism purpose-built for
                    social media.” And he wrote that he could have managed the many
                    business challenges that BuzzFeed has faced better.</p>

                <p>The news makes me heartsick.</p>

                <p>Peretti hired me in 2012 to build a news organization for the
                    exploding social web. For a few years, we felt the wind of
                    Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest at our backs, and we did
                    journalism that treated those sites as the front page of the new
                    internet. At first, we celebrated and immersed ourselves in an
                    optimistic web culture that imagined a reader who cared about
                    which Disney princess she was, and also the <a
                            href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexcampbell/this-battered-woman-wants-to-get-out-of-prison">worst</a>
                    of how
                    the American justice system treated abused women, who wanted to
                    argue about the color of <a
                            href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue?utm_term=.wnrMEoO6y#.agDJKQPRB">the
                        dress</a> and also understand the

                    behind it. That was back when all of it mixed up
                    in your Facebook feed, and it felt novel.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>BuzzFeed News did great work and employed some terrific reporters, but they <em>never</em> had a plan to
                turn a profit that made any more sense than that of <a

            <p>Ina Fried, reporting for Axios:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Ex-Apple employee Imran Chaudhri gave TED attendees on Thursday an
                    early glimpse of the AI-powered wearable that his startup, Humane,
                    has been developing. [...]</p>

                <p>The screenless device, which does not require a nearby cell phone
                    to work, uses a combination of voice and gestures for input and
                    can display information by projecting it onto nearby objects.</p>

                <p>Details: In his TED talk, Chaudhri showed the wearable, which sat
                    in his jacket pocket, translating his own voice into French.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>He also answered a phone call from his wife with the call
                        information appearing as a green image projected onto his hand.</p></li>
                    <li><p>“This is good AI in action,” he said, promising more details
                        would be released in the coming months.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The device — which seemingly doesn’t yet have an announced name? — looks about 2 inches wide and 1 inch
                high, and is worn on your chest like a Star Trek communicator badge. <a
                        href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/humane-ted-bethany-is-calling.jpeg">Here’s an
                    image of the phone call information projected onto Chaudhri’s hand</a>. Hope the whole demo is
                released on video soon.</p>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong> Actually, now that I look at the video clips that are available, I think the
                device is quite a bit bigger, and Chaudhri has it peeking out of a pocket on his jacket? Unclear.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The first book of its kind — a definitive and beautifully
                    designed survey of ’70s, ’80s and early ’90s arcade game pixel
                    typography. Exhaustively researched by author Toshi Omagari (a
                    celebrated typeface designer at Monotype UK) <em>Arcade Game
                        Typography</em> gathers together 250 pixel typefaces, all carefully
                    chosen, extracted, redrawn and categorised by style, and each with
                    an accompanying commentary by Omagari. The title also features 4
                    illustrated essays on videogame typography theory and practice,
                    documenting the unique advantages and challenges presented to
                    designers of these bold, playful and often quirky alphabets.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I bought and devoured this book back in October 2019, but somehow never recommended it here on Daring
                Fireball. I should be arrested for dereliction of duty. But I was reminded of it today by <a
                        href="https://mastodon.social/@antonyjohnston/110232389169824182">this toot from Antony
                    Johnston</a>.</p>

            <p>A book about classic arcade game fonts is <em>so</em> obviously up my alley that I’d probably enjoy a bad
                book about them. But <em>Arcade Game Typography</em> is an exquisitely good book: deeply researched,
                beautifully illustrated with copious screenshots and close-up pixel-by-pixel details, and engagingly
                written by Omagari. I’m linking here to the limited edition hardcover, which costs $46, but <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Game-Typography-Pixel-Type/dp/0500021740/?tag=df-amzn-20">there’s
                    also a high-quality paperback edition for $28</a>. (Buy through that Amazon link and you’ll make me
                rich with a cut of the dough.) If you <em>don’t</em> want this book you’re either too young or you’re
                not hooked up right.</p>

            <p>Mick Akers, reporting for The Las Vegas Review-Journal:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The Oakland Athletics have zeroed in on Southern Nevada, signing a
                    binding purchase agreement for land just west of the Strip where a
                    major-league ballpark could be constructed. The agreement is for
                    49 acres at Dean Martin Drive and Tropicana Avenue, owned by Red
                    Rock Resorts, parent company of Station Casinos.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>That’s close to T-Mobile Arena (home of the NHL Golden Knights), behind the New York New York casino
                complex.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“For a while we were on parallel paths (with Oakland), but we have
                    turned our attention to Las Vegas to get a deal here for the A’s
                    and find a long-term home,” A’s President Dave Kaval told the
                    Review-Journal on Wednesday. “Oakland has been a great home for us
                    for over 50 years, but we really need this 20-year saga completed
                    and we feel there’s a path here in Southern Nevada to do that.”</p>

                <p>With the announcement of the purchase agreement, MLB Commissioner
                    Rob Manfred concurs with Kaval and hopes the A’s shifting their
                    efforts solely to Southern Nevada will lead to the end of the
                    team’s <a
                            href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/athletics/the-as-are-bad-would-a-move-to-vegas-help-2594529/">yearslong
                        quest to leave crumbling Oakland
                        Coliseum.</a></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://stevestreza.com/2020/02/17/ios-adware/">Steve Streza, all the way back in February
                2020</a> (innocent times, that month):</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Over the years, Apple has built up a portfolio of services and
                    add-ons that you pay for. Starting with AppleCare extended
                    warranties and iCloud data subscriptions, they expanded to Apple
                    Music a few years ago, only to dramatically ramp up their
                    offerings last year with TV+, News+, Arcade, and Card. Their
                    services business, taken as a whole, is quickly becoming massive;
                    Apple reported <a
                            href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/28/apple-services-revenue-12-7-billion-q1-2020/">$12.7
                        billion in Q1 2020</a> alone, nearly a
                    sixth of its already gigantic quarterly revenue. [...]</p>

                <p>If you don’t subscribe to these services, you’ll be forced to look
                    at these ads constantly, either in the apps you use or the push
                    notifications they have turned on by default. The pervasiveness of
                    ads in iOS is a topic largely unexplored, perhaps due to these
                    services having a lot of adoption among the early adopter crowd
                    that tends to discuss Apple and their design. This isn’t a value
                    call on the services themselves, but a look at how aggressively
                    Apple pushes you to pay for them, and how that
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking">growth-hack</a>-style design comes at the
                    expense of the user
                    experience. In this post, I’ll break down all of the places in iOS
                    that I’ve found that have Apple-manufactured ads. You can
                    replicate these results yourself by doing a factory reset of an
                    iPhone (backup first!), installing iOS 13, and signing up for a
                    new iCloud account.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Streza’s post emphasizes the new-user experience, and he’s right that longtime users (like you, dear
                reader, probably) don’t see a lot of this. But I do, because when reviewing new devices or new OS
                releases, I’ll sometimes set up as new (and use a spare Apple ID dedicated to testing) to see the
                factory-fresh Cupertino default experience. Is it too much advertising? I don’t know — but it’s a lot.
                One thing that’s clear is that Apple sees Music and TV as Apple-service properties. Yes, you can use
                them for listening to your own music and watching your own video files, but first and foremost these are
                client apps to Apple’s Music and TV+ services. These are not the iTunes and Video apps of yore.</p>

            <p>But what got me thinking about this issue this week is the dumbest adware in iOS I’ve seen. For the last
                several weeks, I’ve noticed <a
                        href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/ios-settings-arcade-ad.png">an ad in Settings on
                    my iPhone</a>, in the iCloud section at the very top of the first screen: “Apple Arcade Free for 3
                Months”. The reason this is dumb is that I pay for a family account for Apple One, <em>so we already
                    have Apple Arcade</em>. But here’s Apple badgering me to sign up for a 3-month free trial that I
                don’t need.</p>

            <p>If I tap into that ad’s section in Settings it explains why they’re offering it: “Services Included With
                Purchase”. I’m not even sure what device I bought that earned me this offer, but it shouldn’t matter.
                Why are they showing me something I already pay for?</p>

            <p>To be clear, I was able to make this ad go away by tapping “Not Now” on the offer screen in Settings. (I
                waited for weeks before doing so to see if it would go away on its own.) And I’m not blankly opposed to
                using this top-of-the-first-screen space in Settings to show offers for Apple’s services or AppleCare
                warranty coverage. But they ought to be presented conservatively, and with surgical precision. Apple is
                doing users a favor if they’re reminding them of offers — like three free months of Apple Arcade — that
                they’ve already qualified for with a hardware purchase. But it’s annoying and confusing that it’s the
                very app where I manage my Apple One subscription that’s suggesting I sign up for a service included in
                Apple One.</p>

            <p>We — including Apple itself and Tim Cook personally — decry the invasiveness of the surveillance
                advertising complex, by which they develop profiles of us so accurate that the ads they deliver are so
                on-point to our recent interests that millions of people falsely believe their devices are somehow
                surreptitiously listening to their real-world conversations. This stupid Apple Arcade prompt in Settings
                is the opposite: I’m being shown it because Apple knows I recently bought a new device from them, but
                somehow doesn’t know that I already pay them for a subscription that includes Arcade. How can they be so
                contextually unaware?</p>

            <p>Promotions for services I might want? Maybe, but Apple should be extremely conservative about presenting
                them — especially in push notifications. Promotions for services I already pay for? That shouldn’t
                happen.</p>

            <p><strong>Postscript, two weeks later:</strong> <a
                    href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/followup_on_apple_services_ad">This bug was triggered by
                the fact that I’m an edge case, with separate Apple IDs for iCloud and for iTunes/App Store
                purchases</a>.</p>

            <p>Warren Buffett, <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1646136625355710464">asked on CNBC</a>
                about Berkshire Hathaway’s largest holding, Apple (<a
                        href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/02/15/berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-58-of-public-apple-stock">they
                    own nearly 6 percent of Apple’s stock</a>)</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“If you’re an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the
                    only proviso is they’ll take away your iPhone and you’ll never be
                    able to buy another, you’re not going to take it. If they tell you
                    if you buy another Ford car — they’ll give you $10,000 not to do
                    that — you’ll take the $10,000 and you’ll buy a Chevy instead.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Buffett, famously, isn’t technically minded. But I think that helps him understand Apple’s value. He’s
                right: Apple’s moat is customer loyalty, and that loyalty is earned through user experiences that other
                companies <em>can’t</em> match.</p>

            <p>Using Ford and Chevy as his counterexamples is serendipitous, <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1647997065589592064">as Dare Obasanjo quipped</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Someone should print this tweet out, frame it and give it to the
                    CEO of GM in commemoration of their decision to stop supporting
                    CarPlay in their vehicles.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It’s true. The <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/04/general-motors-hates-your-iphone/">anger over
                GM’s decision to drop CarPlay</a> and Android Auto support in its EVs is really only anger about
                dropping CarPlay.</p>

                    and privacy while also claiming that it’s possible to surveil
                    everyone’s messages without undermining end-to-end encryption. The
                    truth is that this is not possible.</p>

                <p>We aren’t the only ones who share concerns about the UK Bill. The
                    United Nations has warned that the UK Government’s efforts to
                    impose backdoor requirements constitute “a paradigm shift that
                    raises a host of serious problems with potentially dire
                    consequences”. Even the UK Government itself has acknowledged the
                    privacy risks that the text of the Bill poses, but has said its
                    “intention” isn’t for the Bill to be interpreted this way.</p>

                <p>Global providers of end-to-end encrypted products and services
                    cannot weaken the security of their products and services to suit
                    individual governments. There cannot be a “British internet,” or a
                    version of end-to-end encryption that is specific to the UK.</p>

                <p>The UK Government must urgently rethink the Bill, revising it to
                    encourage companies to offer more privacy and security to its
                    residents, not less. Weakening encryption, undermining privacy,
                    and introducing the mass surveillance of people’s private
                    communications is not the way forward.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I’m glad to see these companies defending end-to-end encryption, but this letter dances around the
                repercussions of this proposed legislation in the U.K. What they mean in the third paragraph quoted
                above is that if the legislation passes, people in the U.K. won’t be able to use WhatsApp or Signal or
                any other end-to-end encrypted service. Apple isn’t a signatory of the letter, but I think iMessage
                would be banned too.</p>

            <p>Some reports are portraying this as though these services would begrudgingly comply if the law passes,
                but they <em>can’t</em>. End-to-end encryption is inherent to the protocols. If end-to-end encrypted
                messaging is banned in the U.K., it won’t mean that WhatsApp, Signal, et al will somehow switch to
                insecure protocols in order to comply — it will mean that people in the U.K. can’t use these apps.</p>

            <p>It’s tough, messaging-wise, because coming right out and saying that <em>sounds</em> like these companies
                <em>won’t</em> comply, by choice. Laypeople seemingly can’t be made to understand that a “good-guys-only
                back door” is cryptographically impossible. But that’s the truth. <a
                        href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1311229/whatsapp-usage-messaging-app-users-by-country/">WhatsApp
                    is incredibly popular in the U.K.</a> — the message should not be that U.K. lawmakers are trying to
                weaken WhatsApp’s encryption, but rather that U.K. lawmakers are going to make WhatsApp illegal.</p>

            <p>New app from developer Zach Simone — an iPhone and Apple Watch app for blood glucose recording, tracking,
                and monitoring. I don’t have diabetes, but I know many people who do or have loved ones who do, and it
                seems hard to overstate how important blood glucose monitoring is. <a
                        href="https://zachsim.one/blog/2023/4/19/introducing-glucomate">Simone, on his blog</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>For over 20 years, I’ve had to monitor my blood glucose every
                    single day. The way in which I monitor it has changed a bit
                    over the years, but the need to stay on top of the readings
                    hasn’t. [...]</p>

                <p>A [continuous glucose monitor] generates a lot of data, and the
                    one I use <a href="https://zachsim.one/blog/2017/12/5/cgm-diaries-day-2">even writes that data to
                        HealthKit</a> (though
                    admittedly with a 3-hour delay). Real-time information is only
                    available via the manufacturers app, unless you’re willing to jump
                    through many hoops. No matter, there’s still a huge amount of data
                    being collected. And it starts to build up. But surely all of this
                    data is good for something. What can we do with it?</p>

                <p>That’s where Glucomate comes in. It’s an app for people who
                    record, track, and monitor their blood glucose and use HealthKit
                    to do it. Glucomate is the app that finally does something with
                    all that data. You can analyse recent readings, spot trends, or go
                    back to any date and view its history. It does all this while
                    trying to look as good as possible. A notable feature is the
                    ability to customise each of the tabs by reordering the displayed
                    data. You can even choose to hide the data that isn’t relevant to you.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The best apps, almost invariably, come from developers scratching their own itches. It looks to me like
                Simone has made a terrifically practical tool for anyone monitoring their blood glucose levels. If you
                have diabetes or know someone who does, Glucomate seems worth a look.</p>

            <p>(There are <a
                    href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/apple-watch-blood-glucose-monitor-could-revolutionize-diabetes-care-aapl">rumors</a>
                that future Apple Watch models might integrate sensors that read blood glucose levels continuously and
                non-invasively (read: without puncturing your skin), but that’s just a rumor, and even if it comes to
                pass, diabetics will still need ways to monitor their trends.)</p>

            <p>Great piece by Aaron Blake for The Washington Post that covers a lot of ground succinctly. This point
                stuck out to me:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Dominion says it’s not done, either, with lawyer Stephen
                    Shackelford saying: “We’ve got some other people who have some
                    accountability coming toward them. And we’ll move right on to the
                    next one.”</p>

                <p>Dominion is also <a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/technology/dominion-voting-mike-lindell-trump.html">suing
                    MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell</a>, who
                    promoted the false <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/?itid=lk_inline_manual_44">election</a>
                    claims on Fox and elsewhere.
                    (Lindell’s fate would also seem to matter greatly to Fox, given
                    that documents in the Dominion case show Fox referring to him as
                    the network’s top advertiser.)</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Part of the way Fox News dug itself such a hole on this matter is that they were satisfying two demands
                at once: their audience wanted to hear these nonsensical lies about the election being rigged, and their
                top advertiser — Lindell — desperately <a
                        href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/27/media/dominion-fox-news/index.html">wanted to come on the
                    air to promulgate them</a>.</p>

                quietly. You’ll never guess which.</p>

            <p><a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/warner-bros-discovery-unveils-max-streaming-service">Warner
                Bros. Discovery</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Warner Bros. Discovery today introduced Max, its enhanced
                    streaming service, which will launch in the U.S. on May 23. Max is
                    the destination for HBO Originals, Warner Bros. films, Max
                    Originals, the DC universe, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter,
                    an expansive offering of kids content, and best-in-class
                    programming across food, home, reality, lifestyle and
                    documentaries from leading brands like HGTV, Food Network,
                    Discovery Channel, TLC, ID and more. Max will stand out amongst
                    streamers by uniquely combining unrivaled breadth and superior
                    quality with iconic franchises and strong product experience, all
                    for great value.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I would argue the opposite: that by cramming their entire disparate gamut of brands into a single
                service, none of them stand out, and the Max brand stands for nothing.<sup id="fnr1-2023-04-12"><a
                        href="#fn1-2023-04-12">1</a></sup></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Max will offer three pricing options, giving subscribers the
                    choice to select which plan best fits the needs of their
                    household.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Max Ad-Lite — $9.99/month or $99.99/year <br/>
                        2 concurrent streams, 1080p resolution, no offline downloads,
                        5.1 surround sound quality
                    </li>
                    <li>Max Ad Free — $15.99/month or $149.99/year <br/>
                        2 concurrent streams, 1080 resolution, 30 offline downloads, 5.1 surround
                        sound quality
                    </li>
                    <li>Max Ultimate Ad Free — $19.99/month or $199.99/year <br/>
                        4 concurrent streams, up to 4K UHD resolution, 100 offline
                        downloads, Dolby Atmos sound quality
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>

            <p>These prices are pretty much the same as <a href="https://www.netflix.com/signup/planform">Netflix’s</a>,
                except that Netflix’s “basic with ads” tier (it’s adorable that Max is calling theirs “ad-lite”) is
                $7/month and, criminally, still limited to 720p resolution. <a
                        href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle">Disney+</a> currently offers
                two plans: $8/month with ads, or $11/month without (and with offline downloads). Disney+ also offers
                bundles with Hulu and ESPN+: $13/month with ads, $20/month without. Apple TV+ — with a growing but
                admittedly boutique-sized library compared to Max, Netflix, and Disney/Hulu — is $7/month, and has no
                tier with ads.</p>

            <p>When this “Max” name truncation was first rumored in December, <a

                <p>Not the worst name they could go with. The mistake with “HBO Max”
                    was muddying the premium HBO brand with the “anything and
                    everything” content of a unified app for everything this enormous
                    content factory conglomerate puts online. My big question is what
                    happens to HBO content. Is it stuck in a tab inside the “Max” app,
                    or will there be a standalone “HBO” app too?</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Looks like HBO is now just a brand inside the Max service. They’re ceding the “everything you get on this
                service is premium content, and there are no ads” ground to Apple TV+. HBO is still HBO on cable, but as
                the world inexorably moves to an all-streaming future, this feels like “corporate synergy” run amok. The
                non-HBO content in HBO Max already diluted the brand; now they’re putting even more non-premium content
                (all the Discovery crap) into the same app. (Today’s New York Times headline says it all: “<a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/business/media/max-streaming-warner-hbo.html">‘Succession’
                    and ‘Dr. Pimple Popper’ Together in New Warner Streaming App</a>”.)</p>

            <p>Disney set the example Warner Bros. Discovery should have followed, with Disney+ and Hulu as separate
                apps, but priced together in a bundle. Disney isn’t relegating Disney+ content into a mere tab in the
                Hulu app, nor are they allowing Hulu’s content to dilute the prestigious Disney brand in the Disney+
                app.</p>

            <p>They obviously think they’ve being clever with <a
                    href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/max-logotype.jpeg">the Max logotype</a> having a dot
                inside the “a”, evoking the “o” in HBO’s, but I find it just sad — the bastardization of an iconic mark.
                Either Max stands on its own, independent of HBO, or HBO should be <em>the</em> brand for HBO content.
            </p>

            <p>HBO’s old slogan was “It’s not TV. It’s HBO”. That slogan captured HBO’s prestige: unedited major motion
                pictures, best-of-breed original content, all without commercial interruptions. HBO’s new slogan might
                as well be “It’s not TV. It’s a tab somewhere in the Max app.”</p>

                        <p>The nomenclatural trend <em>du jour</em> for subscription services is to take your company’s
                            existing well-known brand and tack on a suffix like <em>plus</em>, <em>max</em>, or
                            <em>one</em>. Hence: Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, Apple TV+, Apple One, Google One — <a
                                    href="https://www.canalplus.com/">even Canal+ in France</a>. I think that’s what
                            Warner was going for with the “Max” in HBO Max. So in some sense going with just plain “Max”
                            makes no more branding sense than if Disney+ or Paramount+ had been named just “Plus”. But
                            for those of you my age or older, <em>Max</em> also brings to mind Cinemax — Warner’s
                            longtime cable-pay-channel sibling to HBO. Premium and commercial-free, like HBO, but
                            clearly not <em>as</em> premium. HBO is <a
                                    href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dimagjo01.shtml">Joe DiMaggio</a>;
                            Cinemax is <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dimagdo01.shtml">Dom
                                DiMaggio</a>. HBO is the home of hall-of-fame groundbreaking original series like <em>The
                                Sopranos</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>, <em>Curb Your
                                Enthusiasm</em>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and <em>Succession</em>. Cinemax is the home
                            of ... <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls567109928/">checks notes</a> ...
                            <em>Banshee</em>, <em>The Knick</em>, <em>Warrior</em>, and <em>Mike Judge Presents: Tales
                                from the Tour Bus</em>. Cinemax’s biggest claim to fame from my teenage years is that
                            after a certain hour, they showed movies that earned them the nickname “<a
                                    href="https://screencrush.com/rip-skinemax/">Skinemax</a>”. (Sleepovers were always
                            preferably held at the homes of Cinemax subscribers.)</p>

                        <p>No matter what Warner Bros. Discovery intends “Max” to mean, it feels damn stupid to lean
                            even vaguely on Cinemax, and not at all on HBO, as a brand name.&nbsp;<a

            <p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors, “<a
                    href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/04/general-motors-hates-your-iphone/">General Motors Hates
                Your iPhone</a>”:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I get the impulse to want to control everything that happens in
                    your car, if you’re an automaker. But given the fact that the
                    smartphone is everyone’s <em>real</em> ride-or-die, the best choice is to
                    integrate tightly with the supercomputer we all keep in our
                    pockets, not to say “let them eat Bluetooth” and be happy
                    degrading the customer experience in the interest of control and
                    incremental revenue. [...]</p>

                <p>Will GM’s competitors follow its lead, relieved that the world is
                    finally starting to trend away from bring-your-own-device support
                    in cars? Or will they consider CarPlay a competitive advantage
                    that will allow them to market their own vehicles against GM’s? I
                    sure hope it’s the latter, because we’re never going to give up
                    our smartphones — and if our cars don’t talk to them properly,
                    our in-car experiences will always be second-rate.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>One thought I had regarding this decision by GM is that it’s a bit like selling “smart” TV sets that
                don’t support HDMI input. You get the TV maker’s interface for using apps, games, and streaming
                services, with no choice to plug in a third-party device like an Apple TV, Chromecast stick, or Roku. I
                don’t know of any TV sets like that, but HomePods are sort of like that as speakers. HomePods have no
                traditional line-in for audio — whatever sound comes out of your HomePods, it comes through Apple’s own
                software stack. GM is more like a traditional speaker company. It’d be really weird if, say, Bose sold a
                set of smart speakers that didn’t support line-in, because unlike Apple, Bose isn’t a leading software
                platform company.</p>

            <p>Tesla is seemingly thriving while going its own way software-wise. Rivian is following Tesla’s lead, and
                can’t manufacture their vehicles fast enough to keep up with demand. But both of those companies have
                roots in Silicon Valley, not Detroit. Both Tesla and Rivian seem more like Apple than they do General
                Motors.</p>

            <p>Marques Brownlee had Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe as his guest on his Waveform podcast this week (recorded in
                the cabin of a Rivian R1S), and asked him about Rivian’s decision not to support CarPlay or Android
                Auto. <a href="https://youtu.be/RdjDDtHvUXA?t=709">Scaringe’s answer (11m:49s) was good</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“I mean a lot of the things we do, like whether it’s music or
                    mapping, we have to make sure we integrate in with the
                    best-in-class platforms. But by controlling the system it just
                    allows us to be the ... arbiter, the head chef, in terms of the
                    experience that you get, versus handing over control of what we
                    think is one of the most important parts of the experience.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Rivian sees itself as much as a software company as a hardware one. That’s an ambitious gamble, to be
                sure, but Scaringe’s comments clearly show that Rivian understands the stakes, and are doing this to put
                the overall driving/ownership experience first.<sup id="fnr1-2023-04-10"><a href="#fn1-2023-04-10">1</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>The system that runs the onboard computer is a major factor in car-buying decisions today, and it’s only
                increasing in importance with each passing year. If GM, in collaboration with Google, creates their own
                custom platform that makes people as happy as Tesla’s and Rivian’s do, well, OK. But I have no faith in
                GM or Google to pull that off. I personally know several Tesla owners whose number one complaint is that
                Teslas don’t support CarPlay, and I know other people who have chosen cars other than Teslas solely for
                that reason. A lot of Tesla owners and would-be owners wish Tesla supported CarPlay — and I would wager
                heavily that GM never delivers a system that’s as good as Tesla’s, let alone CarPlay.</p>

            <p>And the fact that GM is doing this in collaboration with Google already puts them in different territory
                than Tesla or Rivian, who’ve created their own entire software stacks. If GM is only going to support
                its own automotive software system, they ought to be willing <em>and able</em> to do the entire thing
                themselves, with confidence that they’ll provide a best-in-class experience for owners. Otherwise this
                seems like a data grab by Google — collecting location, search, and music/podcast listening data from
                every driver of every vehicle GM eventually sells with this system — and a SaaS revenue grab by GM. <a
                        href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/gm-plans-phase-out-apple-carplay-evs-with-googles-help-2023-03-31/">From
                    the Reuters report that broke this news</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Buyers of GM EVs with the new systems will get access to Google
                    Maps and Google Assistant, a voice command system, at no extra
                    cost for eight years, GM said. GM said the future infotainment
                    systems will offer applications such as Spotify’s music service,
                    Audible and other services that many drivers now access via
                    smartphones.</p>

                <p>“We do believe there are subscription revenue opportunities for
                    us,” Kummer said. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is aiming for
                    $20 billion to $25 billion in annual revenue from subscriptions
                    by 2030.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This sounds like a decision motivated entirely by a desire to generate a significant new services revenue
                stream, and not at all motivated by a desire to create the best possible driving/passenger
                experience.</p>

            <p>One influential group that knows the importance of CarPlay integration are car dealers. Say what you want
                about car salespeople, they know exactly what motivates buying decisions. I suspect GM corporate is
                getting an earful from GM dealers regarding this decision. I don’t know if GM is planning to share that
                future subscription revenue with dealers, but they won’t get a penny from every sale lost to a rival
                whose cars do support CarPlay.<sup id="fnr2-2023-04-10"><a href="#fn2-2023-04-10">2</a></sup></p>

            <p>20 years ago Apple presented the Mac as the ideal “digital hub” — the connection between all of one’s
                disparate devices, from MP3 players to cameras. A decade later, Apple went all-in on iCloud, and cloud
                computing in general, as the new hub. But in many ways our phones are our new digital hubs. They serve a
                very different role from what Macs and PCs did 20 years ago. Rather than serve as a hub for
                <em>hardware</em> peripherals, our phones serve as our primary hub for <em>software</em> services and
                apps. CarPlay exemplifies that role.</p>

                        <p>I wonder how much of a factor it is that Apple has spent the last decade not-so-secretly
                            working on creating its own line of cars? There’s no way GM would ever integrate a software
                            system from, say, Ford or Honda. But so why integrate CarPlay, which comes from a company
                            that seemingly wants to compete with existing automakers? Apple’s own car ambitions make
                            CarPlay integration, to some extent, seem like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.&nbsp;<a
