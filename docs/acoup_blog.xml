<p>In particular, I want to talk about the current state of the field of history, particularly in the United States though frankly my sense is things are little better (and in many cases substantially worse) elsewhere.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/03/collections-the-practical-case-on-why-we-need-the-humanities/" data-type="post" data-id="3713">Of course this is an issue I&#8217;ve been focused on for some time</a>, but what drew it into relief recently was finding out about a <a href="https://t.co/sAnHoyPXrE" data-type="URL" data-id="https://t.co/sAnHoyPXrE">data-set of 14 Midwestern US university history departments</a>, charting the change in their permanent faculty.  It&#8217;s a messy data-set in that each school reported figures over different time frames, but they all point in the same direction:</p>

Lauck</a>.  I&#8217;ve briefly exchanged tweets with him since tweeting about this and he says that he is working (with others) on creating a larger and more robust data set.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The figures are <em><strong>catastrophic</strong></em>.  The average department declined by some 34.2%; because small departments have been hit harder, the decline to the total number of permanent faculty historians is <em>merely</em> 29%.  That&#8217;s nearly a third of the discipline in this part of the country vanishing.</p>



<p>And the hit is clearly not just regional.  Permanent faculty in history departments are shrinking nationwide.  I used to muse in years past that if the lethargic hiring in history continued, we&#8217;d see a fairly sudden and rapid decline in the size of departments as the last sizeable hiring periods (the 90s and the aughts) began to retire.  That future is now.  Despite the fact that graduate admissions have begun declining (peak PhDs granted in history was 2013, for students admitted likely in 2007 or so; it has fallen every year since), placement rates &#8211; the number of PhDs in a permanent teaching position in higher education &#8211; have plummeted.  For that 2013 cohort, the four-year placement rate was 54%.  <a href="https://www.historians.org/ahajobsreport2022" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.historians.org/ahajobsreport2022">For the 2017 cohort, the figure is just 27%</a>.  The current placement rate for the 2019 and 2020 cohorts? <a href="https://t.co/BxroUa1KxS" data-type="URL" data-id="https://t.co/BxroUa1KxS"> <em>9.7%</em></a>.<span id='easy-footnote-1-16288' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/23/fireside-friday-december-23-2022-whither-history/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16288' title='Of course part of this stings because I am part of the great big mass left out in the cold by these numbers, still looking for a permanent academic appointment, despite having articles in &lt;a href=&quot;https://biblioscout.net/article/10.25162/historia-2020-0020&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://biblioscout.net/article/10.25162/historia-2020-0020&quot;&gt;global &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110796841/html#contents&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110796841/html#contents&quot;&gt;top-tier&lt;/a&gt; journals and a public scholarship program discussed in places like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/history-video-games-europa-universalis/622892/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/history-video-games-europa-universalis/622892/&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  At some point what you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; simply stops mattering because placement rates are so low that the system becomes almost entirely random.  We passed that point a while ago.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>  Some of these lost positions have become contingent, short-term positions, some have disappeared altogether; the data is insufficient for now to tell which is which.</p>



<p>What happened?  I think there is a story to tell here where the move away from requiring history courses as part of the general education curriculum in many universities caused a decline in enrollment and then universities responded by gutting history departments.  <a href="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/january-2021/history-enrollment-edges-slightly-lower-wide-variation-characterizes-2019%E2%80%9320-enrollment-numbers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/january-2021/history-enrollment-edges-slightly-lower-wide-variation-characterizes-2019%E2%80%9320-enrollment-numbers">At the same time, enrollment largely stabilized post-2017</a> and has remained roughly steady since then, yet universities <em>continue</em> to cut history (and of course more broadly, removing history GenEds was a university leadership decision, so even this story is, &#8220;university administrators create their own excuse to cut history and then do so.&#8221;)  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/">It is the case that students have moved away from the history <em>major</em> into disciplines they think are more financially secure</a>, but that hasn&#8217;t actually reduced <em>enrollment</em>; students still want to <em>take history classes</em>.  <a href="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/april-2017/history-is-not-a-useless-major-fighting-myths-with-data?fbclid=IwAR29teJ0N51VVzaGaYZXq3At4QMmxxx-ZbQ9j4hUmNAce2gjGVaMEWA5dv0" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/april-2017/history-is-not-a-useless-major-fighting-myths-with-data?fbclid=IwAR29teJ0N51VVzaGaYZXq3At4QMmxxx-ZbQ9j4hUmNAce2gjGVaMEWA5dv0">And while we&#8217;re here, it is worth noting that history majors <em>actually do <strong>fine</strong></em> in the broader economy</a>; the idea of history as a degree that can&#8217;t possibly pay for itself is false.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, the decline is shocking, especially continuing in spite of stable enrollment in history courses and remarkably strong public interest.  And that&#8217;s part of what frustrates me so much; my sense is certainly that the public broadly <em>understands the value of history</em>.  I really wonder how many voters would have approved of cutting out the history general education requirements; I rather suspect a ballot measure saying that &#8216;all college graduates in [Your State/Country Here] shall have taken at least a survey course on both World History and [Your Country Here] History before graduation&#8217; would probably pass in most places.  Indeed, I&#8217;m fairly sure it would in the United States because some of that polling has been done; <a href="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/history-the-past-and-public-culture-results-from-a-national-survey/8-how-much-does-the-public-value-the-field-of-history-and-historians-work" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/history-the-past-and-public-culture-results-from-a-national-survey/8-how-much-does-the-public-value-the-field-of-history-and-historians-work">84% of respondents indicated that history was at least as important as business or engineering to learn</a>.</p>



<p>And I think we can dispense with the facile response that moving history out of the university may prove to be good int he end; <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/09/collections-how-your-history-gets-made/" data-type="post" data-id="3786">as we&#8217;ve discussed</a> the sort of research work that forms the foundation for all of the rest of historical education relies on university resources and will not happen in any meaningful amount without them.  <strong>The public <em>thinks</em> they are paying for top notch history research and instruction, while the university leaders and politicians they entrusted with this job are in fact strangling the history of tomorrow in its crib</strong>.</p>



<p>At the same time, some of the leadership in the field have been fiddling while it burns.  As this absolute <em>catastrophe</em> is slowly mulching the entire field, the president of the American Historical Association is over at <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/american-historical-association-james-sweet/671853/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/american-historical-association-james-sweet/671853/"><em>The Atlantic</em> complaining about &#8216;presentism&#8217; and the death of the monograph (the field-to-field research-focused non-general audience book); my God! he warns, pretty soon <em>blogs</em> might even count as scholarship</a>.  <strong>The public <em>believes</em> in history, but someone needs to <em>tell them</em> that the field is dying and yet when the <em>president of the AHA</em> has a platform at <em>The Atlantic</em> he hasn&#8217;t a word about this problem.</strong>  You may well imagine my reaction to that.  </p>



<p>Meanwhile hiring committees continue to prioritize field-to-field research instead of the sort of full-court-press public communications focus necessary to salvage the field or the sort of teaching skill necessary to expand enrollments.  But I think this issue in turn loops back around to the fecklessness of the professional associations.  Hiring committees are run by professors who haven&#8217;t been on the job market in decades, so they&#8217;re naturally going to be a bit &#8216;old fashioned,&#8217; even when they mean well.  Getting them to change course would require some sort of unified message that the field needs to change course, which would probably need to come from the AHA, but again the AHA is asleep at the wheel.</p>



<p>Alternately, you have parts of the field that absolutely have a plan to save history, if only they can win the culture war first.  History is often going to intersect with contemporary politics; so many of our debates about the present have roots in the past.  So I don&#8217;t necessarily feat <em>politicizing</em> the discipline, but I do fear the <em>partisanization</em> of it, wherein the public broadly perceives historians as adjuncts to a specific political party.  <strong>The problem is that all Americans pay the taxes that support higher education and thus our field and so we must in turn serve the whole public, not merely our half</strong>.<span id='easy-footnote-2-16288' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/23/fireside-friday-december-23-2022-whither-history/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16288' title='And to be clear that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we just tell everyone what they want to hear.  The public may choose the questions, but we have to give &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; answers, even &amp;#8211; perhaps especially &amp;#8211; when they are unpleasant.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>  More broadly <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/21/fireside-friday-january-21-2022-on-public-scholarship/" data-type="post" data-id="10916">as I&#8217;ve discussed before</a>, <em>engagement</em> is how we <strong>build </strong>support for a field, whereas <em>activism</em> <strong>spends</strong> support; an &#8216;all activism&#8217; strategy will just serve to squander whatever limited <em>auctoritas</em> the discipline still has.</p>



<p>A great deal of the issue is the structure of the field.  The professional societies are led and hiring is done primarily by tenured academics who are insulated from the worst of the decline.  Indeed, for most of them the last and only thing they will do in this story is retire and when their tenure line isn&#8217;t replaced, contribute one more negative figure in a long tally of negative figures.  They have no <em>personal</em> incentives to change course and while in past generations we might expect concern about field and their own legacies to motivate changes, that clearly isn&#8217;t happening.  I shouldn&#8217;t be sharp with the more senior members of the field (who will, after all, sit on hiring committees) but I feel I must: <strong>this is a failure of stewardship by some senior academic historians who refuse to change course because the storm won&#8217;t affect <em>them</em> even as the rest of the crew drowns</strong>.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to paint with too broad a brush here, there are certainly senior academic historians who recognize the problem and are trying to do something about it and I suspect others who <em>would</em> do something about it if they felt they could, but there&#8217;s also a lot of &#8216;learned helplessness&#8217; when it comes to institutional decline.  And there&#8217;s also a disconnect here between institutions: smaller privates and state schools feel a lot of this more keenly than the most prestigious schools, which is a problem because it is those latter schools that both churn out most new hires and also supply most of the leadership for the professional associations.<span id='easy-footnote-3-16288' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/23/fireside-friday-december-23-2022-whither-history/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16288' title='It is immediately striking to me that the smaller professional associations, like the Society for Military History (SMH), the Association of Ancient Historians (AAH) and the Classical Association of the Middle West and South (CAMWS) both tend to have more diverse leadership in terms of institution and career-stage and also tend to feel more worried and responsive to these changes.  Unfortunately by their very nature as smaller organizations, they generally can&amp;#8217;t move their fields the way the AHA (or in Classics, the SCS and AIA) can.  Also, while I&amp;#8217;m here &lt;em&gt;military history&lt;/em&gt; in particular is in an odd place in all of this because hiring demand from the military itself (for teaching roles in the service academies and PME institutions) is disconnected from broader trends in academic hiring.  So long as cadets must become lieutenants and majors must become colonels, Uncle Sam will need military historians to help teach them.'><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>To my eyes, the solutions are clear but hard to implement because they require those very senior tenured academics to either implement them or for leadership in departments and professional associations to change over.  I think the basic steps to save history are:</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>, <strong>we need data</strong>.  We need to know what strategies work to sustain student enrollment and majors and what doesn&#8217;t and we need to understand the scale and nature of the challenge.  That means we need nation-wide (and international) data on the number of faculty (tenured, tenure-track and contingent), enrollments and majors.  There are<a href="https://twitter.com/MiddleWestRev/status/1605029747813072899" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/MiddleWestRev/status/1605029747813072899"> some really promising efforts</a> to produce this data locally, <strong>but the AHA should take the lead in organizing and accomplishing this</strong> on a nation-wide scale.  Data collection needs to become part of our discipline&#8217;s best practices, so that every department is collecting the same data: we need to know how many jobs we have, which ones are contingent, how many students we have, the courses they take and so on.  Because then we can use that data to refine our battle plan as well as to shame universities that cut functional programs.</p>



<p><strong>Second</strong>, <strong>prioritize publication which communicates to the public</strong>, both sharing our historical knowledge with the public but also work that lets the public know our dire straits and aims to develop their support.  As I&#8217;ve noted before, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/21/fireside-friday-january-21-2022-on-public-scholarship/" data-type="post" data-id="10916"><em>engagement</em> is not <em>activism</em></a>; we first must save the field before we can try to use the authority of the field to argue for other social or political changes, whatever they may be.  <strong>Prioritizing this work will in turn demand changes in how we make hiring and tenure decisions</strong>.  The structure of academia is such that academics <em>do</em> what their hiring and tenure committees <em>incentivize</em>.  Right now, that is narrow research aimed at an ever-shrinking audience of other historians.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/09/collections-how-your-history-gets-made/" data-type="post" data-id="3786">That research is important</a>, but it will be useless if the field collapses on itself.  To get historians to practice, develop skills, become effective communicators and then rally public support, we have to incentivize it in hiring and tenure.  That means hiring and tenuring historians <em>for their robust public engagement</em> in addition to their research.</p>



<p><strong>Third</strong>, <strong>a greater priority needs to be placed on teaching, especially on job candidates with <em>proven teaching records</em></strong>.  As a discipline, especially at the R1 level (which is a huge proportion of our total enrollments because research universities are <em>very big</em>) we continue to prioritize research <em>wildly</em> over teaching in our hiring, to the point that the latter is effectively a non-factor in many searches.  The result is that teaching quality is wildly uneven; some of the most spectacularly gifted teachers I&#8217;ve had were in history departments, but so were some of the worst.  Bad teachers negatively impact enrollments and majors; good teachers positively impact them.  Departments under siege need good teachers more than they need prestigious researchers.  Don&#8217;t misunderstand me: research matters; I am a &#8216;research first&#8217; historian in my scholarly profile (although I get <em>stellar</em> student evaluations, if I do say so myself).  But teaching <em>excellence</em> &#8211; <em>actual</em> teaching excellence, not empty words &#8211; should be what departments are hunting for, because teaching excellence buys the enrollments that buy future tenure lines.  That in turn suggests they should hunt for candidates with teaching experience (typically as adjuncts) that provide the evaluations and enrollments to back up claims about teaching quality, since there&#8217;s little way for a committee to assess the teaching abilities of a candidate with little teaching experience.</p>



<p>Alas, I think the chances of any of this happening, beyond perhaps the first point, remain remote.  Instead the more likely result is more of what we&#8217;ve had over the last decade: the effort to save history will largely be one led by grad students and adjuncts, joined by only a handful of permanently employed academic historians, while many<span id='easy-footnote-4-16288' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/23/fireside-friday-december-23-2022-whither-history/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16288' title='But by no means all'><sup>4</sup></a></span> of the senior professors who enjoy the lion&#8217;s share of the field&#8217;s resources and clout whistle past the graveyard, singing &#8216;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apr%C3%A8s_moi,_le_d%C3%A9luge" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apr%C3%A8s_moi,_le_d%C3%A9luge">après nous, le déluge</a></em>&#8216; (and preferring to hire only historians who share the same attitude).</p>



<p>But history, as a field, is worth saving for the future and so I am determined to try; thanks to all of you I am in a position to keep trying.  As historians we stand not alone but as one link in a chain stretching back to Herodotus and Thucydides on one end and forward into the future on the other; doing our best to preserve the discipline for future generations is a sacred trust, one which we hold not for the sake of other historians but for the sake of the public.</p>



<p>On to <strong>Recommendations</strong>!</p>



<p>First off, more of me!  <a href="https://askhistorians.libsyn.com/askhistorians-podcast-episode-209-public-history-and-outreach-with-bret-devereaux-and-roel-konijnendijk" data-type="URL" data-id="https://askhistorians.libsyn.com/askhistorians-podcast-episode-209-public-history-and-outreach-with-bret-devereaux-and-roel-konijnendijk">I joined Roel Konijnendijk and Steelcan909</a> (since he goes more often by his <em>nom de plume</em>) for a long and wide ranging discussion of public scholarship and outreach.  It&#8217;s a great discussion of the topic, especially because though r/AskHistorians and <em>ACOUP </em>are structured very differently, in the end we&#8217;re aiming to achieve many of the same goals in terms of public history.</p>



<p>On the contemporary security issues front, I think<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/reunification-taiwan-through-force-would-be-pyrrhic-victory-china" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.csis.org/analysis/reunification-taiwan-through-force-would-be-pyrrhic-victory-china"> this brief over at CSIC by June Blanchette and Gerard DiPippo </a>on what a Taiwan crisis &#8216;gone hot&#8217; from a PRC invasion on Taiwan might mean in a broader global context is quite informative, especially for those who haven&#8217;t been tracking this issue closely and so might not have a sense of the stakes.  The brief frames these impacts as a series of points, each led by the assumption (in bold) that supports the impacts that follow, which is a really useful way to guide the reader through things that <em>might</em> happen.  A war over Taiwan would be a catastrophe, which is why it hasn&#8217;t happened yet and why deterring it remains a major policy goal for the United States, but then Putin&#8217;s War in Ukraine has <em>also </em>been a catastrophe, not the least for Russia, and it happened anyway.</p>



<p>Meanwhile over at <em>War on the Rocks</em>, Stephen Biddle (the fellow who coined the concept of the &#8216;modern system&#8217; of war I use so frequently) has written on &#8220;<a href="https://warontherocks.com/2022/11/ukraine-and-the-future-of-offensive-maneuver/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://warontherocks.com/2022/11/ukraine-and-the-future-of-offensive-maneuver/">Ukraine and the Future of Offensive Maneuver.</a>&#8221;  It&#8217;s both a good place to get your feet wet in some of the debates about the (un)changing nature of maneuver in war and also a good antidote to some of the more breathless takes about the &#8216;death&#8217; of this or that system of tactic.  Also to note at <em>War on the Rocks</em>, if you really want to be tracking military affairs in Russia and Ukraine, Michael Kofman now has a podcast there, <em><a href="https://warontherocks.com/premium/therussiacontingency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://warontherocks.com/premium/therussiacontingency/">The Russia Contingency</a></em>, though it is behind the members paywall; it was certainly worth the price of admission for me.</p>



<p>And for this week&#8217;s <strong>book recommendation</strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3Gg48HK" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3Gg48HK">, I&#8217;m going to recommend S. Ogilvie&#8217;s <em>The European Guilds: An Economic Analysis</em></a> (2019).  Ogilvie attempts in this book an almost comprehensive, cross-regional treatment of guilds in Europe from the High Middle Ages through the early modern period.  It&#8217;s a great first step either for students looking to get a handle on guilds (and the debates about them) or for worldbuilders making medieval worlds who want their towns inhabited by realistic guilds who need a good sense of how these organizations functioned and what they were for.</p>



<p>While Ogilvie&#8217;s work is pretty technical in nature, the barrier to entry is substantially reduced by the opening chapter, &#8220;The Debate about Guilds&#8221; which does a good job both in setting up the questions the book will answer but also grounding a new reader unfamiliar with a lot of this debate in what guilds have generally been understood to be.  From that introduction then each chapter tackles an aspect of the regulation of guilds (guilds and markets, guilds and women, guilds and barring entry for some producers, guilds interacting with governments).  Ogilvie&#8217;s approach is in turn relentlessly data-driven and comparative: this isn&#8217;t a discussion of one guild, but rather a comparison of lots of data from many guilds over a wide range of time periods and countries.  That means lots of charts and tables (be still my heart!) but fortunately Ogilvie&#8217;s text does a pretty good job of walking the reader through what those charts and tables are <em>saying</em>.  At the same time, it&#8217;s easier for a reader to pick out outliers and to get a sense of not merely the norm but also the range of variation.</p>



<p>In terms of general readability, I think this may be a slower, more challenging read than some books, not because it is poorly written (I think it is quite well written) but because the topic is technical and data driven.  Nevertheless Ogilvie does a good job of walking the reader through those dense topics and I don&#8217;t think a non-specialist will have any problem working their way through (medieval European guilds are, after all, hardly in my specialty).  That said, this really is an <em>economic</em> study of guilds; some points are illustrated by colorful examples but this is an analysis of guilds rather than the story of them (and thus the attention is often on what guilds are generally rather than on their development and decline or on the details of individual local outliers).  The result is a really useful study of a form of social and economic organization that is often only thinly described in surveys of this period but is nevertheless prominent in the public imagination of it.</p>



<p>Also there are <em>so many charts!</em></p>



<p>I hope everyone has a good holiday season.  Next week we&#8217;re going to have a bit of an odd post as I want to address some of the controversy around a public-facing Classics publication.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week we&#8217;re going to take a look at the worldbuilding of Amazon Studio&#8217;s <em>Rings of Power</em> from a historical realism perspective. I think it is no great secret that <em>Rings of Power</em> broadly failed to live up to expectations and left a lot of audiences disappointed. In the aftermath of that disappointment, once one looks beyond the depressingly predictable efforts to make culture war hay out of it, I found that many people understood that they<em> were</em> disappointed but not always <em>why</em>. <strong>Here I am going to suggest one reason: the failure of <em>Rings</em> to maintain a believable sense of realism grounded in historical societies and technologies (something the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, books and films, did very well)</strong> <strong>makes it impossible to invest in the stakes and consequences of a world that appears not to obey any perceptible <em>rules</em></strong>.</p>



<p>I found as I wrote this that I had broadly two kinds of critiques: the more substantive critiques of worldbuilding in the most literal sense and then a set of nitpicks focused on the presentation of things like arms, armor, tactics and smithing which annoy <em>me</em> but were probably less important for most viewers.  <strong>So this post is going to focus on what I see are the more dramatically relevant failures: scale, distance and social structures</strong>; next week&#8217;s post will then be a companion to this one which will indulge in endless nitpicking on the other topics.</p>



<p>Now I do want to say that if you enjoyed <em>Rings of Power</em>, that&#8217;s <em>fine</em>.  I am not here to tell you that you shouldn&#8217;t have.  I enjoyed parts of it too (mostly the Dwarves; I thought those emotional beats landed best), so I&#8217;m not suggesting it was all terrible.  What I am saying is that I wish those story elements that worked <em>emotionally</em> had been placed in a story that worked <em>logically</em>.  <strong>Also, I am not going to hold back on spoilers, either from the show <em>or</em> from the larger legendarium</strong>; the story of the Second Age is already spelled out in detail in the Silmarillion and I&#8217;m not going to dance around those details.</p>



<p><strong>I think we also ought to head one objection off at the pass here: that it is unfair to hold a TV show to the standards we might a film in terms of things like sets, extras and costumes</strong>.  The thing is, <em>Rings of Power</em> apparently had a <a href="https://screenrant.com/lotr-rings-power-show-budget-billion-amazon-details/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://screenrant.com/lotr-rings-power-show-budget-billion-amazon-details/">$462 <em>million</em> budget</a> to produce eight one-hour episodes;<span id='easy-footnote-1-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16473' title='This is, by the by, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more than the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; budget, which was $10-15m per episode in the later seasons'><sup>1</sup></a></span> by way of comparison Peter Jackson&#8217;s films had a <em>combined</em> budget of $281 million (inflation adjusted c. $470m) to produce 9.3 hours of film (theatrical edition; extended cut is 11.4). <strong> In short the series and the films had remarkably similar budgets to cover remarkably similar amounts of screentime</strong>.  I confess I find myself confused, given the comparison, as to where all of that <em>Rings</em> money went; the show evidently was lavishly produced but it doesn&#8217;t generally <em>feel</em> lavishly produced.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But First, Why?</h2>



<p>Now before we get into the historical critique (because that is what we do here), I want to explain why I think this approach is valid for this sort of media.  <em>Rings of Power</em>, after all, makes no claim to historical accuracy or realism (unlike <em><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/" data-type="post" data-id="5253">Game of Thrones</a></em> or <em><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/" data-type="post" data-id="5079">Assassin&#8217;s Creed</a></em>) and so cannot be faulted for failing to do something it never set out to do.  Nevertheless, there is a failing here and I think that failing is in <strong>worldbuilding</strong> rather than historical accuracy.  <strong>Speculative fiction &#8211; be it fantasy or science fiction &#8211; is a genre where a great deal of the weight is carried by the fictional world being constructed.</strong></p>



<p><strong>We want the fictional world to <em>feel</em> real or at least like it <em>could</em> be a real world, with internally consistent rules and clear lines of effect and consequence</strong>. In part that is because the deep, rich <em>real-ishness</em>, as it were, contributes to the sensation (be it joy or horror, depending on the work&#8217;s tone) of exploring and discovering a new fictional world and <strong>in part it is because a world that <em>feels</em> real and bounded by rules, the way our world is bounded by rules</strong>,<span id='easy-footnote-2-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16473' title='Rules like the length of a day, the force of gravity, the need of humans to eat, the presence of larger social structures and so on.'><sup>2</sup></a></span> <strong>makes the stakes of the story itself more engaging</strong>. The plausible link between causes and consequences, bound by those rules, is what encourages us to invest in characters and to care about their decisions and internal struggles.</p>



<p><strong>One may easily contrast a story set in a world unbounded by rules of logical consequences, like a dream</strong>. Anything can happen in a dream, unrelated to what came before or after. Dreams can break their own rules and they can exist in unreal or surreal spaces. And they also, <em>famously</em>, make for <em>extremely boring</em> stories. <strong>Nothing is quite so tedious as having someone narrate a dream to you, because nothing in the dream <em>actually matters</em></strong> for anything that comes before or after.  Of course nothing in a fictional story necessarily matters in the real world, but nothing in a dream actually matters <em>even in the dream world</em>. <strong>Thus the consistency of the rules and the setting are essential for allowing the audience to engage their emotions with the characters and story because they make the events in the story <em>matter</em> by making them <em>feel</em> less arbitrary</strong>.</p>



<p>Now that feeling of consistency doesn&#8217;t <em>need</em> to be a product of historical accuracy or realism, of course.  Fantasy and science fiction, by their very nature, are built around elements that have no real world precedents.  The story merely needs to be consistent <em>with itself</em>; we&#8217;re very willing to accept fictional worlds with rules very different from our own.  Indeed, that is much the fun of speculative fiction, asking the question of how the world would change if some detail &#8211; often a minor one &#8211; of how our world functioned were different.  <em>That said</em>, historical realism is an effective <em><strong>shortcut</strong></em> to the feeling of consistency because if something functions in the story the way it functions now or did function historically, that is going to generally feel quite real because it <em>actually is</em>.  And more broadly, audiences generally assume that anything that does not <em>obviously</em> work in a fantastical way instead works in ways we commonly understand.</p>



<p><strong>And I&#8217;d argue &#8211; <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/19/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-viii-the-mind-of-saruman/" data-type="post" data-id="3596">indeed, I <em>have</em> argued</a> &#8211; that the works of J.R.R. Tolkien are themselves marked by using exactly this kind of historicizing strategy for producing that feeling of consistency</strong>.  Middle Earth in Tolkien&#8217;s writings, <em>feels</em> real because it so strongly resembles historical systems and settings (or in the deeper past of the <em>Silmarillion</em>, legendary or mythical systems and settings nevertheless immediately familiar to us).  One can see this perhaps most obviously in Tolkien&#8217;s languages; constructed with deep care they <em>feel</em> like real languages because they practically <em>are</em> real languages, based heavily in his own knowledge of linguistics and modeled in function off of real languages that exist (e.g. Finnish was, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages_(Tolkien)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages_(Tolkien)">according to Tolkien</a>, the &#8216;dominant influence&#8217; in the early construction of Quenya).</p>



<p>Alternately, one might just take a quick shortcut and use a historical thing itself &#8211; a system, a set of rules, etc. &#8211; because it will already be internally consistent and grounded.  Whereas Tolkien invented his Elvish languages, he used Old Norse and Old English to &#8216;translate&#8217; the tongues of the Rohirrim and the Dwarves.  Or, to take a science fiction example, the language of the Fremen (Chakobosa) in <em>Dune</em> feels really real and grounded when its words and phrases appear because <a href="https://baheyeldin.com/literature/arabic-and-islamic-themes-in-frank-herberts-dune.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://baheyeldin.com/literature/arabic-and-islamic-themes-in-frank-herberts-dune.html">a lot of it is just Arabic</a> (with a lot of admixture).  <strong>When making a speculative fiction world, the author(s), can either plan out the system&#8217;s unique function or they can adopt a real world system, <em>but they generally must do one or the other </em>or risk sacrificing audience investment from a world that lacks consistency</strong>.</p>



<p>And as noted above, <strong>Middle Earth and the broader Tolkien legendarium draws its sense of consistency when it comes to the world and its societies mostly from a firm sense of rootedness in the <em>realia</em> of historical societies and historical literature</strong>.  Tolkien has not reinvented new systems of farming, new laws of physics or new systems of social organization.  <strong>In <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> the world&#8217;s consistency depends on its feeling of historical rootedness</strong>.</p>



<p>In good speculative fiction then, the creator has a choice: import recognizable, real-world systems that will feel real to an audience or build new systems and then <em>explain</em> their fantastical workings to the audience in a way that renders them understandable.  <em>Rings of Power</em> does neither and in the process manages to construct a Middle Earth that is not only &#8216;flat&#8217; in the sense that the the cataclysms of the <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Changing_of_the_World" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Changing_of_the_World">Changing of the World</a> have not yet happened and thus the <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Straight_Road" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Straight_Road">Straight Road </a>to Valinor can still be traversed, but <strong>unfortunately this Middle Earth is also flat in the sense that it is rendered dull and uninteresting by the lack of perceptible rules and consequence</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Problems of Scale</h2>



<p>The first problem we can delve into is how little of <em>Rings&#8217; </em>Middle Earth seems to be in the right scale, particularly in terms of population and space.  When watching I found myself repeatedly asking, &#8216;wait, how many people <em>live </em>here?&#8217;  Of course I don&#8217;t need the show to stop and give me a census, but in order to understand the stakes of the conflict and what the success or failure of the heroes might <em>mean</em>, it is important to have some sense of how big these places are, how significant the number of people involved are and so on.  And at almost no point does the show do a decent job of expressing any of this.</p>



<p>We can start with the Southlands.  The show is relatively cagey after the first episode about giving us clear maps (we <em>see</em> snippets of them for early establishing shots, but they&#8217;re never put in the context of where the <em>other</em> snippets of map are, making it hard to keep track of the geographic relations of these places), I assume in an effort to disguise some of its &#8216;reveals&#8217; (such as the Southlands actually being Mordor), but even without that it is clear this is supposed to be a large area.  It evidently is big enough to have a royal line and a traditional kingdom (that Halbrand is saying-not-saying he&#8217;s the heir to) large enough to be worth putting someone on that traditional throne.  And yet from what we see, this entire kingdom consists of a pair of villages, one of which is ruined and abandoned before the action of the show in that area properly <em>starts</em>.  It is watched over by a robust garrison of apparently five or six Elves, seemingly concentrated in a single outpost.<span id='easy-footnote-3-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16473' title='We might normally pardon this issue by assuming this one outpost is just one of many in a large network, except that the ambush of this one small group preventing any word getting back to the Elves about the return of Orcs to this region is a plot-point and it really does seem that this is the only squad.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>  Needless to say, <em>kingdoms</em> generally consist of more than one or two villages; they usually contain many <em>towns and cities</em>, of which the Southlands seems utterly devoid.  Instead &#8211; and we&#8217;ll come back to this &#8211; the political seat of power in the Southlands is a small, poor village apparently run by its butcher before being taken over by its widowed apothecary.</p>

<p>The result is a plot, focused on &#8216;saving the Southlands&#8217; which makes no sense no matter how you think about it.  If these people &#8211; Bronwyn is able to address all of them in one small courtyard, there can&#8217;t be more than a couple hundred &#8211; are all of the remaining people of the Southlands than the quest to save them failed before the story got there and it makes no sense at all for anyone to suppose making Halbrand king of these 200 or so people would do anything to change the political or military situation in this part of the world.  Alternately, if there <em>are</em> other large settlements (towns! cities!) then it makes no sense that the Númenóreans beeline to <em>this village</em> at top speed or that these villagers recognizing Halbrand as king would in any way be meaningful.  <strong>For this plot to work, <em>this needed to be a large political and administrative center</em>, which is to say it needed to be a <em>city</em>.</strong></p>

Bronwyn is a Welsh name, her son is &#8216;Theo&#8217; a name root that Tolkien uses heavily in Old English Rohirric names (From <em>þeod</em>, &#8216;people,&#8217; e.g. Theodoric) or alternately it is Greek (&#8216;theo-&#8216;meaning &#8216;God&#8217; in compound names like &#8216;Theodosius,&#8217; &#8216;given by God&#8217;), since he is Theo and not Theod, it seems to be the latter.  Theo&#8217;s friend is named &#8216;Rowan,&#8217; which is an Irish name while &#8216;Waldreg&#8217;s name seems entirely made up (though it could be Germanic with &#8216;Wald&#8217; meaning &#8216;wood, forest&#8217; and -reg meaning&#8230;well I&#8217;m not quite sure honestly; Welsh rheg meaning &#8216;curse&#8217;?).  Naming is, of course, something Tolkien was extremely careful about; the sorts of names these folks have should <em><strong>tell us</strong></em> something about them.  The fact that we have apparently Welsh, Greek, Irish and maybe Old English names all swirling around this one village is baffling; surely these people <strong>have a language</strong> which they <strong>name their children in</strong>?</figcaption></figure>



<p>One can easily contrast the similar stakes (in the films, not the books) of the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/01/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-i-bargaining-for-goods-at-helms-gate/" data-type="post" data-id="2943">Battle of Helm&#8217;s Deep</a>.  There we&#8217;re told &#8211; again, in the films &#8211; that some significant percentage of Rohan&#8217;s <em>people</em> are present and thus their survival is at stake.  I discussed in that series why this doesn&#8217;t quite work from a demographic perspective, but the films <em>do</em> put a lot of effort into selling this.  We&#8217;re told Helm&#8217;s Deep is very big, with big caverns, that supplies need to be laid, we see an evidently quite large refugee train going there and we get lots of scenes of areas crowded with extras moving through to impress on us there are <em>a lot of people here</em>.  By contrast the whole of the survivors of the Southlands are able to fit inside <em>a single tavern</em> by the time it comes for the decisive &#8216;cavalry saves the day&#8217; moment.  At that stage, there can hardly be a day to save!  This vast land likely populated originally by hundreds of thousands if not low-single-digit millions of peasants has now been reduced to the size of a middling Division 1 Football team (American football, that is).</p>



<p>Which is well enough given that the size of the Númenórean force is also <em>ludicrously</em> small.  A lot of the discourse as the series was first airing seized on the Númenórean ships for the apparent absurdity of how many troops they were notionally moving as compared to how much space there seemed to be on the ships, leading to fun illustrations like this one:</p>

<p>And yes the boats are a problem but hardly the worst problem with the entire expedition.  Still, we can start on the ships here briefly.  We&#8217;re told the expedition consists of 300 soldiers; when we see these fellows in action, they are all mounted, so this is 300 cavalry.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/y1n6rd/n%C3%BAmen%C3%B3rean_ship_capacity_is_totally_possible/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/y1n6rd/n%C3%BAmen%C3%B3rean_ship_capacity_is_totally_possible/">Despite valiant efforts to salvage this</a>, <strong>no, these ships are not <em>anywhere</em> near large enough to move that kind of a force</strong>.  The comparison has been made between these ships and classical Greek triremes and indeed they seem to be roughly the same size, around 120ft length-over-hull.  But they are <em>very</em> different ships; triremes were coast-hopping oared warships and the 200 men they carried were almost <em>entirely</em> rowers (the layout of the space is also different; because of the long prow and curved aft, the Númenórean looks to have less usable internal space than a trireme).  Rowers had to eat, sleep and relieve themselves <em>at their benches</em> because the ships lacked space for anything else; triremes were built for speed above all other considerations and so lacked quarters of any kind (even for the officers) and couldn&#8217;t carry but a couple of <em>days</em> of supplies (thus the coast-hopping).  Packed like a trireme, the Númenórean ships ought to be standing room only and certainly would lack the supplies for the long voyage to Middle Earth.</p>



<p>But the real problem isn&#8217;t the <em>men</em>, it is the <em>horses</em>.  <strong>Horses, of course, are famously quite a bit bigger than humans and thus generally require specialized transports</strong>.  Ancient writers like Thucydides and Polybius are, in fact, often quite careful to separate out specially refitted horse-transports from the rest of a fleet transporting an expedition for this very reason.  Thucydides tells us it took one such <em>dedicated horse transport</em> &#8211; which was not moving troops or other supplies &#8211; to move <em>30</em> horses (Thuc. 6.43), which was conveniently all the initial Athenian expedition against Syracuse had.<span id='easy-footnote-4-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16473' title='Likewise at Ecnomus there were a significant number of dedicated Roman horse transports, so many that one of the four squadrons of the fleet had to be delegated to tow them during the battle to keep them safe, Plb. 1.26.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_transports_in_the_Middle_Ages" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_transports_in_the_Middle_Ages">The capacity of medieval horse transports was similar</a>, around 30 per ship of roughly this size.  The major problem here is not only are horses large and require stalls (since they are hardly used to sea transport) they also require lots of <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/07/29/collections-logistics-how-did-they-do-it-part-ii-foraging/" data-type="post" data-id="14164">food and water</a>, which has to be carried too.</p>



<p>And 300 cavalry are going to require <em>more</em> than 300 horses.  At the very least each rider (I won&#8217;t say &#8216;cavalryman&#8217; because there are clearly some women in this force) needs a horse and a spare (realistically several).<span id='easy-footnote-5-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-16473' title='The Athenians on Sicily occasionally got away with less because they assumed friendly local communities where they could &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; horses; later cavalry reinforcements were sent without horses but with money to buy more locally.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>  On top of that, they are likely to require support personnel (grooms, handlers, servants, pages, porters, etc.), at least one per rider.  So our 300 cavalry rapidly becomes a minimum of 600 people and 600 horses, <em>at a near-minimum</em>.  That is perhaps six ships carrying troops and supplies and twenty more carrying horses (which is why you don&#8217;t send all-cavalry expeditions by sea, infantry is far more sea-portable); twenty-six ships total.  Not three (or five, as they started out with).  At <em>minimum</em>.</p>



<p>But honestly all of this is burying the lede by quite a lot, because the real problem here is that <strong>this expedition is absurdly, comically small</strong>.  Númenór is an island <em><strong>continent</strong></em> with multiple major cities, the largest of which evidently looks like <em>this</em>:</p>

<p><strong>In short, this is a <em>big</em> society, likely with a population in the low millions.</strong>  At the <em>very least</em> we&#8217;re talking about a polity on scale with the classical Athens at its height (perhaps c. 1.5m including the Delian League); realistically much larger given <em>just how much</em> monumental architecture we see (because the surplus to support many hundreds or thousands of workers building it has to come from <em>somewhere</em> and that requires a lot of land and a lot of farmers).  My own guess would be a polity no smaller than the mid-third century Roman Republic, so perhaps 5m people or so.  This is a <em>big</em> society with a <em>lot</em> of wealth.</p>



<p>And this is no minor expedition!  <strong>The <em>queen</em> of this society is <em>personally</em> going on this expedition.  That means at minimum bringing a substantial chunk of the royal household with her. </strong> That almost certainly is going to mean dozens of advisors, courtiers, servants, entertainers, retainers, and so on: where the ruler goes, the court follows and the court of even quite small rulers could be quite substantial.  Diodorus (summarized by Photius) notes that Eunus, the leader of a large slave rebellion on Sicily (135-132) who styled himself as a monarch had a bodyguard of 1,000 men and a court that included a cook, baker, bath masseur and master of entertainments.  For a more established state example, the <em>weakest</em> major successor state to Alexander the Great was the Antigonid dynasty in Macedon.  Their kings had a guard of &#8216;royal horse&#8217; of at least 400 cavalry and an elite infantry unit that defended the king called the <em>agema</em> (there was also a cavalry <em>agema</em>) numbering 2,000 men.<span id='easy-footnote-6-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-16473' title='Polyb. 4.67.6; on the strength of the Macedonian army generally and its units, Taylor, &lt;em&gt;Soldiers &amp;amp; Silver&lt;/em&gt; (2020), 79-83 is a handy overview in English.'><sup>6</sup></a></span>  His court would have been in addition to that figure, so the total royal entourage might have been something like 2,500 people total (or more!).</p>

Also, we&#8217;ll come back to this, but these are badly designed ships that wouldn&#8217;t function well.  Also, is it just me or does it really look like their masts can&#8217;t fit under that bridge there?</figcaption></figure>



<p>And then on top of that royal court, we need <em>the actual army</em>.  As noted, Númenór seems to be a lot bigger than even the very largest of Greek <em>poleis</em>.  But for comparison the initial Athenian expedition to Sicily (which had to be subsequently reinforced) numbered some 136 warships (134 triremes, 2 smaller penteconters), 6,400 fighting men, 30 horses, 1 horse transport, 30 supply ships and another 100 smaller boats carrying an array of supplies and non-combatants essential to the force (bakers, carpenters, etc.; Thuc. 6.43-4).  Númenór itself seems also intended visually to evoke Rome; the Romans don&#8217;t even <em>have</em> an independent operational maneuver unit of a few hundred.  At minimum an offensive operation like this would involve a legion (4,200 infantry, 300 cavalry) and more likely two legions plus an equal or greater number of <em>socii</em> (non-Roman &#8216;allies&#8217;) for a total force around 20,000.  Which would <em>certainly</em> not fit on just three ships.  The Númenóreans expect to find a hostile enemy army potentially waiting for them (remember, they think Sauron is out there) and they also expect to need to found a kingdom for Halbrand; this is major military operations and yet they&#8217;ve sent an army too small to even function as a <em>foraging party</em>, much less an army of conquest.</p>



<p>And while we&#8217;re here I feel the need to note this <em>royal expedition</em> is smaller than some of the <em>disappointing</em> reinforcements Minas Tirith receives from the declining and depopulated outlands of Gondor; three hundred men from the Ringlo Vale, five hundred from the Blackroot Vale, a hundred fisher-folk of the Ethir, three hundred men from Pinnath Gelin and seven hundred infantry and a company of cavalry from Dol Amroth (RotK, 46).  And that was, notably <em>far fewer </em>than had been hoped, but &#8220;less than three thousands full told,&#8221; <em>ten times</em> the size of this expedition, despite Gondor being a declining, exhausted kingdom.  For what it is worth I think the solution to this problem is to remove Queen Míriel from the expedition, reframing the whole thing as a scouting party sent to explore the feasibility of creating a kingdom for Halbrand rather than the main effort; that could explain why the force was so small.  Then, make only perhaps 30 of them cavalry, put the rest on foot and have the whole group take between six to ten ships.</p>



<p>Of course they may not have needed to pack too many supplies in those ships because they appear to have borrowed Euron Greyjoy&#8217;s late-season <em>Game of Thrones</em> teleporters for both their ships and their horses, which brings us to&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Problems of Sail</h2>



<p>The physics of this world make no sense.</p>



<p>We can start with travel time.  We&#8217;ve been through this here before, but Tolkien is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/" data-type="post" data-id="90"><em>meticulous</em> </a>in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> when it comes to keeping track of who is where and how fast they can move.  Such meticulousness isn&#8217;t <em>strictly</em> necessary in fantasy fiction &#8211;<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/10/06/new-acquisitions-how-fast-do-armies-move/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2019/10/06/new-acquisitions-how-fast-do-armies-move/"> G.R.R Martin sure isn&#8217;t so careful</a> and in his books it is mostly fine &#8211; but in a story where major events hinge on the cavalry arriving to stave the day, a <em>plausible</em> if not accurate sense of how fast things move really is essential.</p>



<p>And here episodes five and six of <em>Rings</em> are an absolute disaster.  Part of the problem is that we, as the audience, can actually mark the progression of time here pretty well because Arondir and Bronwyn&#8217;s scenes have lots of time-of-day and &#8216;by nightfall&#8217; sort of indicators; we can <em>watch</em> as the sun rises and falls between scenes.  Queen Míriel decides to do the expedition at the end of Ep. 4, by which point the Southlanders are already in <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Watchtower_of_Ostirith" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Watchtower_of_Ostirith">Ostirith</a>.  Early in Ep. 5 we see the ultimatum delivered and the Southlanders preparing to be attacked; the expedition has not yet departed; the sequencing of scenes here is important.  We get Bronwyn giving a speech in a scene lit like it is morning, then a series of scenes in different places set in progressively later times of day until eventually we see Rowan betray Southlanders and join Adar that night.  This sort of thing isn&#8217;t &#8211; or <em>ought</em> not &#8211; be an accident, we are being <em>shown</em> the progression of time.  Then we pick up the next morning with the fleet departing Númenór.</p>



<p>In the next episode, it&#8217;s night again at the beginning and Adar is attacking the tower but surprise the villagers have snuck away; this is <em>immediately </em>followed by a scene of the fleet moving <em>at night</em> just before dawn; Galadriel and Isildur watch the sun come up and we hear they are in sight of land.  We then switch to the villagers preparing to defend their village at morning (with the strong implication that this is <em>the same morning</em>) for the attack that is coming that very night.  Then a big combat scene, during which we get fast cuts between the orcs breaking into the Last Inn and its maybe three-dozen survivors and the Númenórean cavalry swiftly closing at what seems to be dawn, with the action syncing up as the Númenórean cavalry storms into town to disrupt the sack of the inn at the last moment.</p>



<p>Which leaves us with the unavoidable implication that the Númenóreans caught site of the coast, sailed up the Anduin, disembarked on what will be the Pelennor Fields, and then rode through Ithilien and through the pass at Cirith Ungol (famously difficult to move through) and then down into the vale (what will be the plain of Gorgoroth in a few minutes) all in a single day and night (having crossed the sea to get there in perhaps a week at most).  <strong>That is, by my measuring, some <em>three to four</em> <em>hundred miles</em>, half by land and half by river, accomplished in 24 hours.  <em>Gandalf</em> on <em>Shadowfax</em> does not move this fast.</strong>  Normally here is where I would joke that when an army moves this fast I no longer ask how much fodder they need for their horses, but how much gasoline they need for their trucks, but <strong><a href="https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/">many a modern <em>mechanized</em> force</a> would struggle to move so fast over open country without resupply set up in advance</strong>.  </p>

Even Aragorn in his dead sprint from the Paths of the Dead to Minas Tirith did not cover so much ground<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/14/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-vi-black-sails-and-gleaming-banners/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/14/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-vi-black-sails-and-gleaming-banners/"> and he took <strong>eight days</strong> to do it</a>.<br>This map is from the LotR Project (<a href="http://lotrproject.com/">http://lotrproject.com/</a>) – go check them out.</figcaption></figure>



<p>And the Númenóreans set out on this <em>dead sprint</em> despite being entirely unaware that there was anything to sprint to!  Remember, they have no idea there is a battle at all, much less where it is, yet their army plows blindly without scouts or supplies at maximum speed into what may well be enemy territory.  And yet, thanks to our problems of scale, they manage to teleport to the <em>one village</em> in the whole of the Southlands that still has any people in it.  It sure is great that they didn&#8217;t have to waste any time scouting but automatically knew that the battle would be taking place at the <em>only village in the Southlands</em>.</p>



<p>Once again, I feel the contrast to the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is notable here.  There the reinforcing armies &#8211; Gandalf with Erkenbrand (or film!Éomer) and then later Théoden &#8211; know exactly where they are going on known routes and have a very good sense of when they are likely to need to get there.  As we&#8217;ve <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/31/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-iv-the-cavalry-arrives/" data-type="post" data-id="246">discussed </a>at <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/01/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-i-bargaining-for-goods-at-helms-gate/" data-type="post" data-id="2943">length</a>, the movements of these armies are carefully timed in the books (somewhat less so in the films, but never this egregiously).  The defensive solution for <em>Rings of Power</em>, of course, is to argue that the two timelines are not actually moving together, that the expedition has in fact been in motion for weeks or months.  There are two problems with this: first, that goes against the <em>very clear</em> signalling in the show where the time of day between the two sets of events is carefully tracked, which is a way of very clearly telling the viewer <em>these things are happening at the same time</em>.  Second, the writers get no credit for solutions they didn&#8217;t put in the show <em>because they didn&#8217;t put them in the show</em>.  Apart from the Hobbits (Harfoots), all of the different plot threads we see link up at one point or another and at no point does anyone suggest they&#8217;ve been advancing at different rates (which also has some baffling implications for Elrond too who has been racing multiple times between Ost-in-Edhil in Eregion, Forlond in northern Lindon and Moria né Khazad-dûm; the fellow has some frequent flier miles after that, I&#8217;d bet).</p>



<p>But frankly it also feels like <em>physics</em> don&#8217;t work quite right here either and here my focus goes to the catastrophic eruption of Orodruin (Mt. Doom).  I am, of course, not a volcanologist and at best I only somewhat dimly remember the course I took in undergrad on earthquakes and volcanoes (shake and bake!), but the mechanism by which the teeming, green Southlands were reduced blasted wastes and then the results of that struck me as absurd the moment I saw them, which of course led me to do some reading.  The immediate silly thing was that the Special Sword acts only as a key to apparently turn a <em>physical mechanism</em> to open the dam, moving what appears to be many tons of stonework to do it without a pulley or a winch (or a hundred burly fellows pulling) to be seen.  Perhaps there is a magical electric motor quietly hidden under the tower, but again &#8211; and I cannot stress this enough &#8211; the writers do not get credit for things <em>they did not put in the show</em>.  Otherwise I do not believe for one moment that the one fellow with the sword can produce enough torque on it to move the massive stone blocks holding back the river.</p>

Perhaps my physics is just off but I do not buy that this is enough water entering the caldera fast enough to produce the blast we see.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In either case an big flood piles down through the plains.  Which is a problem because we <em>see</em> the opening in the dam and it is only so wide, with just gravity pulling on this water (it isn&#8217;t pressurized), yet by the time we&#8217;re at the valley floor, we&#8217;re seeing great huge waves and enough water pressure to cause the orc tunnels to <em>explode</em> with rock-tossing force (even before any of this water has become steam).  That&#8217;s not how <em>water works</em>; this water isn&#8217;t pressurized at all and these tunnels all have outlets.  The water then falls through an open channel into a great cauldron of lava (with a lot of open space full of at-atmospheric-pressure-air because there is a great big channel linking this to the outside), triggering a massive explosion, which blows the top of the mountain.  The eruption is <em>tremendous</em>, sending out a single massive shockwave that our heroes can feel many miles away, flinging volcanic bombs miles away from the explosion and visibly tearing the mountain apart, while ejecting lots of red-hot gasses and incandescent rock particles.</p>

Of course this water is going to flash to steam, but it&#8217;s going to do so on the surface of the lava, because the lava is several times denser than water, so the water will float on its surface.  And then that steam has this <strong><em>huge cavern</em></strong> to expand into and then the wide opening the water is flowing through to push out of.  I can absolutely believe it could create a geyser of very hot water out of that hole (one big, oversized kettle), which might be very bad if you were close to it, but I have a hard time thinking that enough steam pressure is going to build up here to rip off the top of the mountain.  Perhaps my sense of the physics is wrong, but a pressure bomb requires <strong>containment</strong>, the one thing we&#8217;re shown is not present here.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now steam-explosion eruptions are a thing, they&#8217;re called phreatic or phreatomagmatic eruptions.  But as far as I can tell, they do not work this way.  Purely phreatic eruptions (where there is no magma activity, just steam explosions caused by super-hot rock flash-evaporating steam) tend, as far as I can tell, to be small and rarely involve liquid lava being ejected at all.  They are, as best I can tell, thought to be a product of rising magma meeting the local water table (not the water table falling down to the magma).  The biggest phreatic eruptions tend to be the result of magma interacting with with <em>the freakin&#8217; ocean</em>; the quantities of water involved are a <em>lot</em> higher than the tunnel of water we see and involve magma <em>already under pressure</em> and pushing upwards to meet the water.</p>



<p>Closer to the right scale would be something like the phreatomagmatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_eruption_of_Mount_Pinatubo" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_eruption_of_Mount_Pinatubo">eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991</a>.  The thing is, that eruption, which hit its climactic phase in June, had precursors as early as April.  One indicator that eruption was imminent was reduced SO<sub>2</sub> emissions detected in May, which indicated that gasses were being trapped in the magma, leading to a pressure buildup; Orodruin shows no sign of this.  If anything we see clearly that the magma chamber has a pretty clear, unobstructed air outflow enabling the release of gasses.  In any case, the phreatic part of Pinatubo&#8217;s eruption were not the <em>cause</em> of the eruption, but warning signs, as volcanic activity triggered smaller steam events starting in April; the main eruption was still magmatic, resulting from a build up of pressure caused by unreleased gasses in the magma, not steam explosions.  As I understand it then what happens is that gasses build up inside of the magma which pushes it upwards and as the magma rises nearing the eruption it hits pockets of water in the ground which flash to steam and explode (because there&#8217;s no pressure release), creating small phreatic eruption precursors (and earthquakes) before finally the pressure of the magma itself triggers the climactic, massive eruption.</p>

<p>This is a situation where I&#8217;d welcome any volcanologists reading to weigh in the comments; it may well be that what we see on screen is most plausible than it looked (if that happens, I&#8217;ll throw in a post-publication note here).  But to my own untrained eyes and subsequent reading, it seems like the kind of eruption we see just isn&#8217;t going to be produced by a single steam explosion, but rather ought to be the culmination of a lot of building pressure.  For my own part, I think this is a scene which would have benefited greatly from some <em>actual magic</em>, giving us a sense that Sauron, as a Maia and the lord of this land, was exerting his control to <em>make</em> the mountain erupt in this way from an otherwise fairly trivial cause.  But of course the writers couldn&#8217;t <em>do</em> that because the show was at this point still obsessed with the &#8216;mystery box&#8217; approach to &#8216;who is Sauron!?&#8217; &#8211; a storytelling strategy I will say I found misguided and fundamentally boring.<span id='easy-footnote-7-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-16473' title='I always thought they should have taken the &amp;#8216;Columbo Approach&amp;#8217; to Sauron &amp;#8211; show us who he is at the very beginning and make the story about how the characters discover or fail to discover who he is.  Instead the show is larded up with red herrings (Adar before we see him, the starfall not-Gandalf-man, the three strange priestesses, the strange sword itself and so on) which all become pointless narrative dead-ends the moment you realize who Sauron actually is.  For what it is worth, I guessed it fifteen minutes into episode five when Halbrand, despite notionally being a either a random refugee or a noble is inexplicably able to forge a masterpiece sword (complete with bimetallic engravings!) in one sitting with no training like he&amp;#8217;s a mid-game Skyrim character.'><sup>7</sup></a></span>  And once again it is no good suggesting that there <em>is</em> actual magic here, just not on screen because &#8211; again &#8211; <em>it isn&#8217;t on screen</em>.</p>



<p>The problem here is that the nonsensical nature of both the character&#8217;s rescue and then their defeat rob both of any stakes.  I had a hard time <em>caring</em> about the battle in Ep. 6 because I knew at the beginning that the Númenóreans would show up just in the nick of time dramatically at dawn regardless of how little sense it made.  That arrival wasn&#8217;t <em>earned</em> it just <em>happened</em> so we could have a &#8216;cool&#8217; battle scene (that is a visual mess and makes no sense but more on that another week).  And the downfall of the heroes didn&#8217;t feel like the result of their hubris or choices, it felt like they lost because their enemy opened up the &#8216;disasters&#8217; menu in SimCity and chose &#8216;<a href="https://simcity.fandom.com/wiki/Volcano" data-type="URL" data-id="https://simcity.fandom.com/wiki/Volcano">Volcano</a>.&#8217;</p>



<p><strong>And then in turn the heroes <em>surviving</em> the eruption didn&#8217;t feel earned because&#8230;wait, <em>how the hell did they survive that</em>?</strong>  Episode 6 ends with the village engulfed in an onrushing wave of burning, red-hot ash that is expanding with explosive force and lighting trees on fire as it moves.  It blasts open doors, incinerates rooftops and then we see it envelop Galadriel as she looks on.  <strong>These people are very, <em>exceedingly</em> <em>excessively </em>dead</strong>.</p>

<p>That is not a survivable situation and yet not only do some of them survive, <em>functionally all of them do</em>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Problems of Social Detail</h2>



<p>Why yes, that was a long and tortured way to go for that rhyme, thanks for noticing.</p>



<p>The issues with physical and cultural scale then ripple out into the structures of life that we see; <strong>we can start with the Harfoots</strong>.  <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Harfoots" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Harfoots">Tolkien&#8217;s actual writings about the early Hobbits are sparse</a>, almost entirely contained in the &#8220;Concerning Hobbits&#8221; section of the <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> prologue.  Unfortunately, while I imagine the showrunners thought they were hewing fairly close to this description, they&#8217;ve managed to drop out key details or miss things likely implied by the description and thus produced a fairly baffling society that seems to have little connection to what I suspect Tolkien imagined.</p>



<p><strong>The Harfoots appear to be a relatively isolated hunter-gatherer culture</strong> (primarily <em>gatherer</em>, we see little emphasis on hunting, more on that in a moment) <strong>that are nomadic, moving regularly with a collection of carts</strong> (apparently one for each family unit), <strong>that double as housing and are camouflaged but also make for a neat colorful village when set up</strong>.  That they are isolated is made clear with their first appearance; the humans who dwell near them know them so little little about them that the two hunters we see treat them as almost mythical; at no point do we see them interact with or trade with other communities of any kind, nor, when they are in trouble do they consider seeking the aid of those communities <em>or other communities of Harfoots</em>.</p>



<p>I found this culture pretty bafflingly incoherent; I&#8217;m going to be honest, I think what happened was that the designers mixed elements (especially visual motifs) of hunter-gatherer nomads, pastoral nomads, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itinerant_groups_in_Europe" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itinerant_groups_in_Europe">travellers </a>without realizing that those are three <em>very different</em> cultures based on <em>entirely</em> different subsistence systems.  But we can easily rule out the latter two; pastoral nomads are, after all, <em>pastoralists</em> and the Harfoots are not moving sheep between pastures here.  Their society would make <em>far more sense</em> if they were and I&#8217;d argue that a somewhat cleverer reading of Tolkien would suggest this is how he may have imagined them, but in any case, they clearly aren&#8217;t pastoralists here.  Meanwhile, travellers are itinerant communities that operate <em>within</em> larger settled, agrarian or industrial societies whose system of economic subsistence does not work without that larger society.</p>

It ought to be really important if it is where they get <strong>all of their wool</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As hunter-gatherers though, Harfoot society explodes with frustrating questions, the first of which that occurred to me was where did they get all of the heavy wool textiles they wear and drape on <em>everything</em>?  Because <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/03/05/collections-clothing-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-high-fiber/" data-type="post" data-id="6351">of course as we&#8217;ve discussed</a>, wool comes from <em>sheep</em> that have to be herded; cotton and linen come from <em>plants</em>, which have to be farmed.  That&#8217;s not to say the Harfoots can&#8217;t have clothes, but given the subsistence system they have, they can&#8217;t have <em>these</em> clothes.  And what they <em>absolutely </em>can&#8217;t make themselves are all of these metal pots and tools they seem to have.<span id='easy-footnote-9-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-16473' title='Apparently some of the concept art included a portable tinker-forge.  This suffers both from the same &amp;#8216;not in the show&amp;#8217; disease as many other things, but even if it &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; in the show would still be silly.  Hunter-gatherer societies generally cannot support much in the way of specialized labor (like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; data-id=&quot;4526&quot;&gt;smith or a charcoaler&lt;/a&gt;) and in any case how would the Harfoots get a reliable source of metal?  Scrap iron may be common in the modern world, but it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; common in the pre-modern one.

<p>Then there are the carts.  Now the idea of hunter-gatherer nomads using carts is not very &#8216;out there.&#8217;  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/" data-type="post" data-id="5401">As far as I know</a> &#8211; and this is one of those questions where the &#8216;answer&#8217; can shift quite quickly with new discoveries &#8211; the domestication of the horse on the Steppe is generally thought to have preceded the arrival of the wagon.  But that doesn&#8217;t rule out carts or cart-<em>like</em> innovations for nomads: nomadic and semi-nomadic Native American groups often used what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travois" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travois"><em>travois</em> </a>&#8211; a triangle-shaped wheel-less sort of dragging cart and it&#8217;s sometimes supposed similar devices may have been in use on the Steppe.  Before the arrival of horses in certain areas these were pulled by hand (or by dog!).  So it&#8217;s not hard to imagine nomads moving goods by cart pulled by hand with the right sequence of technologies.</p>



<p>But they&#8217;re not going to use <em><strong>these</strong></em> carts.  The carts and <em>travois</em> of Steppe or Plains nomads (the latter being in some cases true hunter-gatherers and thus valuable <em>comparanda</em> here) did not double as living spaces.  People <em>lived</em> in tents which were <em>moved</em> on carts along with their other belongings, which tended to be fairly spare because when you have to move everything you think <em>really hard</em> about if a new item is worth the effort of moving.  The resulting carts are pretty minimal.  A <em>travois</em> is two poles with a net or bag strung between them, while Steppe carts consist of two wheels and a flat bed (often just a frame of the bed with some cross-beams to save weight) and that&#8217;s <em>it</em>.  <strong>You can strap your disassembled tent and other goods to that cart and the light construction keeps it <em>light</em> because every pound of cart is one less pound of <em>things you can have</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The Harfoot carts, on the other hand are quite large and fully enclosed, with an extending lean-to to make a full (if fairly flimsy and not very temperature controlled) structure when parked; the interior space of the cart, packed full of goods on the move, becomes part of the living space when parked.  The Harfoots thus <em>live in their carts</em>, a thing the nomads above <em>do not</em>.  And it is hard for me not to think here that the showrunners are trying to evoke <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers">Irish travellers</a>, especially given the heavy use of Irish accents at play among the Harfoots.  And I feel the need to note that this is a set of choices, so far as I can tell, that have gone over <em><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio/2022/08/31/rings-of-power-the-new-hobbits-are-filthy-hungry-simpletons-with-stage-irish-accents-thats-1bn-well-spent/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio/2022/08/31/rings-of-power-the-new-hobbits-are-filthy-hungry-simpletons-with-stage-irish-accents-thats-1bn-well-spent/">extremely </a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/sep/28/irish-people-have-faced-centuries-of-discrimination-why-are-lord-of-the-rings-accents-so-offensively-bad" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/sep/28/irish-people-have-faced-centuries-of-discrimination-why-are-lord-of-the-rings-accents-so-offensively-bad"><em>poorly</em> </a>in Ireland.  But it also makes <em>no sense</em> for <em>these proto-Hobbits</em> to work this way because, as noted, traveller society is absolutely dependent on an existing settled society for its subsistence strategy (itinerant working requires someone to <em>work for</em> after all), which is not at all how the Harfoots live.</p>



<p>And what is perhaps most striking to me is that none of this is required by Tolkien&#8217;s actual description of the Harfoots.  Tolkien describes a people who &#8220;preferred highlands and hillsides,&#8221; were &#8220;the most inclined to settle in one place,&#8221;&#8221;the longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes&#8221; and &#8220;had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times.&#8221;  To my reading this suggests not fully nomadic hunter-gatherers totally isolated from settled society, but semi-nomadic transhumant <em>pastoralists</em>, likely raising sheep in those highlands and hillsides and trading heavily with the Dwarves (who might supply that metalwork in exchange for the pastoralist&#8217;s wool).  One could easily imagine seasonal migrations that bring <em>these</em> Harfoots and their sheep down to the entrances to the great Dwarf holds, where the sheep are sheared and the wool traded, with each group having a &#8216;main base&#8217; village composed of small, subterranean dwellings (<a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Smials" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Smials">smials</a>).</p>



<p>Instead of that, however, we get a hunter-gatherer society that makes <em>no sense</em> and is also oddly willing to dispose of <em>entire family groups</em> if they fall behind rather than working together, which is doubly frustrating given that (<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2021/07/25/femur/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2021/07/25/femur/">though the famous Margaret Mead quote may or may not be apocryphal</a>), <em>mended bones</em> are some of the <em><strong>earliest </strong></em>signs of complex social structures we see because they indicate that an injured individual in a group was cared for while they couldn&#8217;t care for themselves.  Why is this a society where <em>no one</em> is willing to help pull the one injured person&#8217;s family&#8217;s cart?  Do none of the other families have an teenage or adult child who might be spared for the effort?</p>



<p>But such nonsense societies are par for the course in <em>Rings of Power</em>&#8216;s Middle Earth.  Bronwyn&#8217;s village is, at least initially, apparently run by the innkeeper.  We don&#8217;t <em>see</em> any other figures of authority and that&#8217;s who Arondir goes to for his fortnightly inspection in Ep. 1; later of course the village comes to be run by its apothecary, Bronwyn.  What we don&#8217;t see is, say, a village elder or a collection of village elders or an elected or acclaimed chief or perhaps a somewhat wealthier peasants with larger landholdings running the village or any real forms of political organization of the sort we might expect in a village like this.  Now I understand that the writers have made a deliberate decision to dispense with pre-modern gender stratification and labor division,<span id='easy-footnote-10-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-16473' title='Which I think is an understandable story decision to make these societies more relatable, but not a historical one.  On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://acoup.blog/2021/03/19/collections-clothing-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-spin-me-right-round/&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; data-id=&quot;6538&quot;&gt;labor-and-subsistence factors&lt;/a&gt; which produced that stratification and labor division, see E.W.

Briefly put, in an agrarian society with high infant mortality, no baby formula and no mass produced textiles, the division of labor which emerged (where men do most, but not all, of the farming and fighting and women work primarily in food preparation, textile production and child care) in nearly all complex agrarian societies was necessary for communal survival in the long term.  And I want to be clear because this point, which I think is accurate &lt;em&gt;concerning the past&lt;/em&gt;, is occasionally mobilized culturally in the present that just because a set of labor systems were necessary &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; does not mean that they were good nor does it make them necessary &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; good &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.  The wonderful thing about technology is that it means I don&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to live like a subsistence farmer; I will most surely not do so on a volunteer basis nor can hardly expect the other half of the population to do so.'><sup>10</sup></a></span> but a story where enthroning a new king in this land is a key goal can hardly also dispense with <em>political systems</em>.  Broadly, this is a story <em>about</em> political systems.</p>

<p>Which is why it is so frustrating that none of the more developed political systems are quite right either.  The show cannot quite decide, for instance, exactly how Númenór is run.  There are guilds that issue tokens and apparently one must be a guild member to work in the city <em>at all</em>.  Oddly, Pharazôn is at one point explicit that <em>everyone</em> belongs to a build, asking an assembled crowd to &#8220;look down, each of you, at the guild crests you bear;&#8221;  this is not how guilds work (on how actual guilds worked see Ogilvie, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3UIDKKo">The European Guilds</a></em> (2019); guilds generally restricted who could be the <em>owner-operators</em>, not the amount of unskilled or menial labor they could employ and the whole point was to be <em>exclusive</em> so most people in a town were not members of any guild at any given time). And despite that, these guilds seem to have no <em>political</em> presence at all.  Never do we see the queen having to interact with the various leaders or representatives of each guild.  Instead, we see Evil Vizier Pharazôn shaking hands in the market and giving speeches to angry crowds (Ep. 4; starting at 5 minutes in).  Is this some sort of Republic where the opinion of the urban populace <em>matters</em> and if so <em>how</em>?</p>

But we have a lot of finely dressed nobles here too; who are they?  Is there a hereditary nobility here?  Surely if there is (in the books there is!) their opinions are going to matter rather more than the crowd outside?  Alternately, if the court really is composed of the representatives of each guild, a sort of senate-as-advisory-council, then perhaps <strong>tell us that</strong>.

<p>The same problem bedevils the Elves.  Apart from Gil-galad being in charge, we get little sense of the actual political organization of the kingdom he runs and how exactly his authority relates to Elrond, Galadriel and Celebrimbor.  The fact that &#8211; as in the books &#8211; Gil-galad is really just <em>primus inter pares</em> running a loose confederation of Elven kingdoms (and thus can&#8217;t really order Galadriel to do <em>anything</em>, but then hell, even the <em>Valar</em> struggle to get Galadriel to do anything she doesn&#8217;t want to) is never really properly explained either.<span id='easy-footnote-14-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-16473' title='I don&amp;#8217;t know that we ever get a full list of the vassals Gil-galad has as High King even in the books.  He rules Lindon directly but the other kingdoms of Elves were founded by Elves looking to &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt; Lindon, so his rule over them cannot have been as direct.  At the very least there was Eregion, ruled by Celebrimbor, Greenwood ruled by Oropher and his son, Thranduil (dad of Legolas) after him, and Lothlórien, ruled by Celeborn and Galadriel who &amp;#8211; not that the show would tell you &amp;#8211; by this point is married and has an adult daughter (Celebrían) who ought to be dating Elrond.  There are also the Grey Havens, ruled by Círdan, who seems to be a more direct vassals of Gil-galad but also a mighty elf-lord in his own right.'><sup>14</sup></a></span>  But all of the Elves we meet except for Arondir&#8217;s company of scouts are not random Elves but in fact <em>elf-lords</em> of high lineages, most of whom are or will shortly be rulers of their own quasi-independent realms and yet again we never get much of a sense of the political implications of all of this.</p>



<p>Now I want to be clear, I do not need the show to come to a dead stop to give me a powerpoint slideshow on exactly how all of these folks fit together.  And I know that they couldn&#8217;t necessarily <em>use</em> all of these neat details from the Silmarillion.  But I <em>do</em> want to feel like someone, at some point has <em>thought about these questions </em>and and that isn&#8217;t a feeling that <em>Rings</em> gives me.  <strong>And in a show where major plot-points hinge on political systems (what will Númenór do?) or subsistence systems (where will the Harfoots get food now that their trees are burned?) the audience is going to want to feel like the writers have <em>thought</em> about these questions rather than merely planning to &#8216;make it up as they go along.&#8217;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Flat Middle Earth</h2>



<p>And that is the recurring problem with the worldbuilding in <em>Rings of Power</em>, that the audience rapidly finds that cannot have much faith at all that the creators involved have given much thought to these questions.  And each crack in the worldbuilding in turn damages the stakes of the peril and the significance of character choices <strong>because if the story itself doesn&#8217;t have to obey <em>any</em> real rules of cause and consequence and thus the creators can merely opt to have <em>anything</em> happen for <em>any reason</em> then there is no reason to invest in any of it at all</strong>.  If there are no consistent rules to this world then nothing matters and if nothing matters&#8230;<strong>why should I care?</strong></p>



<p>Now I hardly think this encompasses all of the awkward worldbuilding and visual design choices the show makes and I have so many little, less consequential, complaints about those elements that I&#8217;m going to leave them for an entire <em>second</em> post (hopefully fairly soon).  But I singled these problems out because they cut to the core of the story itself.</p>



<p>To take Galadriel as an example, she is our main character; we meet her first and she connects all of the various plot threads that we see (except for the Harfoots).  And yet at almost every stage of her journey we are dealing with some set of systems the rules of which are unexplained.  First, Galadriel is compelled by Elven politics that are never explained, ordered by Gil-galad, whose relationship to her is not explored, to go West on the basis of an order it was never clear to me he could <em>actually give</em>.<span id='easy-footnote-15-16473' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/16/collections-why-rings-of-powers-middle-earth-feels-flat/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-16473' title='And yet another book note: in the broader context of the legendarium, Gil-galad&amp;#8217;s order would have been a mix of nonsense and impiety.  Galadriel was one of the few surviving leaders of the original Noldorian rebellion and as such a ban was placed &lt;em&gt;by the Valar&lt;/em&gt; on her return to the West.  Gil-galad is thus at once demanding that she flap her arms and &lt;em&gt;fly&lt;/em&gt; to the West for as much good as it will do, and insulting the more-or-less &lt;em&gt;gods&lt;/em&gt; in the process.'><sup>15</sup></a></span>  What is the nature of his authority over her and of her authority over others?  Then she is thrust immediately into the politics of Númenór, which are <em>also</em> underexplained.  Then she joins the inexplicably small, inexplicably teleporting expedition before surviving the least survivable volcanic explosion ever put on film (and then heads for a ring forging scene that left me <em>profoundly</em> confused), before heading off to forge some rings out her suddenly boundless trust for the one being in Middle Earth she hates more than all others (and has now learned has been cleverly deceiving her for essentially the whole show).</p>



<p>Now I know that the creators of the show didn&#8217;t have full access to the <em>Silmarillion</em> and so their story <em>had</em> to diverge in important ways from that text.  But nearly all of the divergent decisions they made seemed, to me at least, quite bad, actively undermining the story, its world and setting.  In particular, it seems to me that at every point decisions were made as to what would make that <em>scene</em> potentially cool or compelling or visually interesting.  The entire &#8216;Who is Sauron&#8217; mystery stands as perhaps the apex of this approach, a collection of red herrings whose emotional impact is lost the moment the audience figures out who is Sauron, creating a lot of scenes with tons of fake foreshadowing that becomes pathetic in second viewing and already feels lame in recollection.  Each idea was built for the scene or maybe, <em>maybe</em> for the episode &#8211; and then treated as if the moment that was done it no longer mattered.  And if it doesn&#8217;t matter to the writers, why ought it matter to me?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s because a good story &#8211; in this case a good TV season &#8211; is not just composed of a collection of visually interesting scenes strung together.  There has to be a glue that retains the emotional interest of the audience; indeed that glue <em>matters more than the scenes or single episodes</em> because it is what fosters the investment in the scenes.  Many great films and TV shows with far smaller budgets have landed far heavier emotional punches with scenes that were far less <em>visually</em> compelling or interesting because we actually <em>cared</em> about the characters involved.</p>



<p>Instead <em>Rings of Power</em> has its big &#8216;cavalry saves the day&#8217; moment and I felt <em>nothing</em>, because the stakes were either unclear or already undermined by the unreality of what was happening and because the sudden arrival of the cavalry was both unearned and yet sadly predictable.  By contrast, Peter Jackson puts a <em>lot of work</em> into the arrival of the Rohirrim; that is the result of hours of character development, the culmination of several character&#8217;s emotional journeys and we&#8217;ve been <em>shown</em> the decisions that make it possible without the need for a 400-mile teleport to luckily arrive at the one tiny village.</p>



<p><em>Rings of Power</em> is, reportedly, coming back for another season, despite having been something of a disappointment to both Amazon and audiences.  What I would ask the creators to learn from the rocky start is that they need to plan and write the show not for the <em>scenes</em> but for the <em>season</em> (and indeed, for the <em>series</em> to avoid the <em>Game of Thrones</em> disease); build a <strong>world </strong>and <strong>characters</strong>, not scenes.  Most scenes are not emotional payoffs but emotional investments in much larger payoffs down the line; trust audiences to stick it out.</p>



<p>And fix the damn travel times.  Transporter Chief Euron was three years ago and no one liked it then either.</p>

<p>Note from the Editor: I&#8217;m excited to feature another guest post with you all!  This week we have James Baillie discussing how digital humanities and prosopographic methods can be used to better understand the history of the medieval Caucasus.  Prosopography is a historical tool-set that is about charting the networks, connections and commonalities of people, often people about whom we otherwise know very little.  It&#8217;s a tremendously important methodological approach, especially in pre-modern history where everything we know about even important figures may only add up to a few lines of text.  In the days of yore, this all had to be done by hand (slowly and often missing things), but this is a field where the potential of information technology &#8211; that&#8217;s the digital humanities here &#8211; is very great indeed.  That said, this is a form of historical work I generally do not do, so I&#8217;m very excited to have someone who does talk through some of the methods and how they can help us to understand the past.</p>



<p>Baillie is in the final stages of his Ph.D. at the University of Vienna and is also a Project Assistant with the Caucasus Digital Repository in the Austrian Academy of Sciences.  His research demands not only that he be a historian but also experience with coding and other information technologies, an impressive dual skill-set to be sure!</p>



<p>And with that, over to James!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’m James Baillie – a historian specialising on digital approaches to the history of the medieval Caucasus region. I’m based at both the University of Vienna and the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and am coming towards the end of my doctoral work. In this post I’ll start with a look at the Caucasus and why I take my particular approach to it, and then go on to the underlying method – prosopography, the study of collected historical person data – before looking at some of the conclusions we can draw from it, in order to give you a bit more insight into the particular processes of research I go through. Finally, I’ll wrap up with some thoughts on why this matters for the Caucasus and why all of this is important in a wider context too.</p>



<p>So, without further ado, welcome to…</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">High Medieval Georgia</h2>



<p>The Caucasus – the mountainous region that sits between Anatolia, Iran, and the southern Russian steppes, between the Black and Caspian seas – has throughout recorded history been a diverse and contested part of the world. It was, in the High Middle Ages as now, a culturally varied region with a range of overlapping ethnic and political entities: the overlaps, as we shall see, very important for understanding the medieval period. As a quick aside on what we mean by medieval &#8211; I tend to use the European-style terms and rough chronological definitions of what is medieval here, and my high medieval focus stretches from the 11<sup>th</sup> to the very early 13<sup>th</sup> centuries. Scholars in the region, however, often have a different and much broader understanding of ‘medieval’ which has roots in Soviet schools of history that suggested that the longer periods of ‘serfdom’ in the region meant the ‘medieval’ or ‘feudal’ period lasted until around 1800. Within all this I focus on the history of Georgia in particular, or as it is natively known <em>Sakartvelo</em> (საქართველო), the land of the Kartvelian peoples.<span id='easy-footnote-1-16352' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/09/meet-a-historian-james-baillie-on-digital-humanities-and-the-medieval-caucasus/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16352' title='“Sa&amp;#8230; o” is a common circumfix, also found in e.g. mepe for king becoming samepo for kingdom or mzareuli for cook becoming samzareulo for kitchen.'><sup>1</sup></a></span> In traditional narratives, the medieval history of Georgia is the precursor history of a Georgian state. This arises from the needs of nineteenth and twentieth century Georgian historians both before and under Soviet rule: for those opposed to Russian domination, the country’s twelfth century rulers, who were able to project power far further, could help present Georgia rhetorically in the same frame as European states and nations. Both Georgian liberalism and nationalism have typically been West-facing projects over the last two centuries, in reaction to Russian imperial claims.<span id='easy-footnote-2-16352' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/09/meet-a-historian-james-baillie-on-digital-humanities-and-the-medieval-caucasus/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16352' title='By ‘imperial’ I don’t just mean ‘during the period of the formal Russian Empire’: the approach of the USSR to places like Georgia was still fundamentally imperial in practice, even if some parts of the ideology and rhetoric had nominally changed.'><sup>2</sup></a></span> Meanwhile, for the USSR in particular, the history of medieval statehood, suitably framed, was an acceptable form of history to be writing, portraying the state as protagonist versus the story’s antagonists, the nobility and church who might undermine state authority. The history of the medieval state as such was <em>both</em> important to Georgian liberals and nationalists <em>and</em> acceptable to Soviet authority, and flourished as a result.</p>



<p>The history that emerged from this is one of a “golden age” triumph of a series of increasingly powerful state rulers, most notably David IV “the Builder” in the first quarter of the 12<sup>th</sup> century and Tamar in the last quarter, who are portrayed as having successfully won two zero-sum contests. The first of these was an external one, between Christian Georgia and its Muslim rivals such as the Turco-Persian Eldiguzid dynasty. The second was the internal struggle, in which the great feudal lords as a class struggled to maximise their independence from the central power of the state, with the aim of becoming as independent as possible. Finally, however, the Mongol invasions crushed the power of this Georgian state. Much of this school of thought dates back to the grandfather of modern Georgian history, Ivane Javakhishvili: his work is not available in English but books like Mariam Lordkipanidze’s ‘Georgia in the 11<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> Centuries’ and Roin Met’reveli’s more recent ‘Golden Age’ follow similar lines. &nbsp;For those new to the field, Stephen Rapp’s overview paper ‘Georgia before the Mongols’ is one of the best available introductory counterpoints to show the issues with how the traditional narratives are put together.</p>



<p>The traditional view of Georgia’s medieval history is not entirely wrong – but it is some way, too, from being entirely right. Two main critiques can be levelled: first, that it emphasises grand narratives based on classes of person, so the ‘nobility’, or the ‘church’, or indeed the Bagrationid dynasty’s monarchs across several generations, are often assumed to consistently have the same collective ideas and aims. This is often too simplistic a model for any real political system, especially when stretched over many decades. The second critique is that traditional histories tend to be very explicitly focused on the state and office-holding, and to use these elements to explain what’s going on: much ink tends to be spilt on topics like whether it was important that the creation of the formal title of <em>Atabeg</em> in around 1210 created a rival role of similar prestige to the <em>Mtsignobart’ukhutsesi-Chq’ondideli</em>, a senior religious advisor and vizier responsible for the royal chancery. I would certainly not attempt to claim that this was entirely <em>un</em>important, but I would suggest that comparatively insufficient attention has been given to the social context of power: who knew who, how ethnicity and gender affected people’s connection to power, and so on. It is in this context that a methodology that helps us examine those latter problems, that of <em>prosopography,</em> enters the chat.</p>

Different colours indicate different types of &#8216;node&#8217; representing people, places, sources, events and identities.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Prosopography is the systematic study of groups of past people</strong>: it requires us to create formal, structured sets of data about people, but in ways that do <em>not</em> assume that what we aim for is a statistical data-set to run calculations on. Medieval chronicle sources are too selective and patchy to allow for that sort of statistical analysis. Indeed, the fact that premodern data are patchy is precisely why building prosopography collections matters. We might not be able to say much from individually looking at the small number of elite women recorded at the medieval Georgian court, many of whom get one or two source mentions, and we don’t have a consistently sampled data-set on all or indeed any of them. However, if we can collect all of those references together in a structured data system and look at them as a group, we can start identifying shared characteristics and build up a picture that we couldn’t see if we left them sitting individually in their respective bits of source material. Being able to find patterns as possible explanations or lines of research can open up new windows on the past by, in effect, rearranging the things our sources <em>already said</em> into new configurations and by connecting in bits of external data such as geolocating the places that sources discuss.</p>



<p>Another thing we get out of prosopography besides this change of perspective is a process of learning about our information by putting it into a structure to start with. One finds quickly that there are certainly limits on any such system &#8211; there are some things about the past that cannot be captured by systematising them, because they are too subjective or contextual. When I am at home in Vienna, the fact that I am a European is unremarkable, and the fact that I am British stands out because almost nobody else is asking for milk in their tea: conversely, when I return to my native island, my being British fades contextually into the background, but my firm sense of European identity is a much more contested, political part of who I am. <strong>It is relatively easy to capture the fact that I hold multiple identities, but not <em>why</em> and <em>when</em> they matter.</strong></p>



<p>Structured data tends to lose that information – but despite that, we gain an awful lot by using it is a more rigorous assessment of our starting assumptions. On what basis are we saying someone was a “Georgian” or an “Armenian” in a historical context? Is it a specific designation given to them in a text, an assumption based on their name and family ties, or a contextual reading based on their religion and allegiances? Forcing ourselves to go through historical sources, person by person and place by place and event by event, and asking ourselves what claims we feel comfortable making is valuable – sometimes vital – work.</p>



<p>It might be useful here to give a more concrete example. Enter the Orbeli, or Orbelian, family. The Orbelis were at the heart of Georgian politics through the middle decades of the 12<sup>th</sup> century, holding some of the highest offices of the court. Intrigue was rarely far behind: they were deeply tied up in the events around the death of the short-lived <em>Mepe</em> (King) David V, and may have been responsible.<span id='easy-footnote-3-16352' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/09/meet-a-historian-james-baillie-on-digital-humanities-and-the-medieval-caucasus/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16352' title='The Georgian term &lt;em&gt;mepe&lt;/em&gt; is gender-neutral for a reigning monarch (although Georgians at times inconsistently use dedopali, a term for queen consort, when talking about any other country’s queens, their own queens regnant are always mepe just as is the case for their male rulers and there is no contemporary evidence that this came with any assumption of masculinity or masculine traits).'><sup>3</sup></a></span> They raised David’s son Demna through the reign of his younger brother Giorgi, eventually rebelling in an attempt to replace Giorgi with their protégé. Their defeat opened the way for Giorgi’s elder daughter, Tamar, to become the first woman to rule Georgia.</p>



<p>The English-language Wikipedia page for the Orbelis confidently states that they were an Armenian family. If we look at Georgian-language Wikipedia, it equally bluntly opens by stating that they were a family of eastern Georgian nobility. Which is correct? Well, when we look at our sources, both. The 12<sup>th</sup> century Orbelis were religiously Orthodox rather than Armenian apostolic, but clearly had roots in both communities – their fortress of Lori was in the Georgian-Armenian marchlands. Their family chronicle, written some decades later, further adds interest to the puzzle by claiming that they took names from both Georgian and Armenian, but were in fact a Chinese family originally that had turned up some thousand years earlier: this is almost certainly a family myth or heroic ancestry tale, but shows the complexity of how people in the 12<sup>th</sup> century wanted to present their own ethnic backgrounds. Even if the rough data-level solution (I tag them as both Georgian and Armenian) is a huge simplification, the process of gathering that data on an individual level can teach us a huge amount about how we try to fit people into categories. It can certainly be a quick lesson in the risks of accepting the defaults from one source tradition or of taking the assumptions of scholars who, even if doing very good work, simply weren’t interested in this part of the problem, used a word that seemed about right, and then moved on.</p>



<p>You can now appreciate, hopefully, what prosopography is – a structured system, but fundamentally a humanities method that remains open to multiple approaches and interpretations. But what does it tell us?</p>

Fortunately for this piece, we get to skip filing in nearly a thousand of these and go straight to the interesting bits.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">More Prosopography!</h2>



<p>Heading back to the Caucasus, and skipping over several years of data entry and structuring (a project I may be continuing to add to for years to come), we certainly can reach some interesting conclusions about how medieval Georgian society worked that change our picture of the dominant, centralising state.</p>



<p>One thing is the importance of <strong>connectivity</strong> – which was often linked to ethnic identity. People often start looking at the past by assuming that being outside the dominant ethnic group was a disadvantage in historical societies – and that is often true, but the picture can be more complex. The Georgian commander of the armed forces (amirsp’asalar) was rarely a Georgian with no other ethnic background in the 12<sup>th</sup> century, with two mixed Georgian-Armenian families (the Mkhargrdzeli/Zakarian and Orbeli/Orbelian) dominating the post, plus figures like a Kipchak general called Kubasar holding the role. One likely reason for this is that these people had better connections to local nobility or sources of troops – Armenian-connected families may have helped legitimise Georgian claims on Armenian-majority regions, and Kubasar was appointed in the middle of a rebellion, probably to ensure the loyalty of large forces of Kipchaks who had been invited into Georgia a generation earlier in exchange for military service.</p>



<p>This wasn’t something I expected to find, at least in this form. One of my starting points was to look at regional rulers (<em>eristavis</em>) and evidence for decentralisation and local/regionalist sentiment within Georgia: but there’s actually little evidence that this was a motivating political factor. On the contrary, Georgia’s elite culture seems to have been quite centralised on the court. This was not because the state had effectively centralised its infrastructure and brought the nobility under its heel into serving the state, though: Georgian monarchs seem to have often aimed to increase, not decrease, the power of their vassals, on the grounds that this reflected significantly greater prestige onto them.<span id='easy-footnote-4-16352' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/09/meet-a-historian-james-baillie-on-digital-humanities-and-the-medieval-caucasus/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16352' title='This would be a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interesting system to model in certain Crusader Kings 3 government forms.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>  The court could then become the social focal point for the south Caucasus, with the courtiers’ connections beyond it being vital for then turning that social focus into raising military manpower, governing cities, raising religious buildings, and other such functions.</p>



<p>Connectivity was probably also vital for women’s power. Queen Tamar is sometimes held up as the singular, sole example of feminine power in the 12<sup>th</sup> century Caucasus, but her aunt Rusudan was the widow of a Sultan who negotiated a key peace deal between the Seljuks and her brother Giorgi III. When Tamar faced down a coup at the start of her reign, her negotiators with the plotters were senior women from noble houses, too. Elite women tended to move between households and regions, and so their ability to form information connections – what in network science might be termed <em>brokerage</em> – gave them access to particular styles of power-as-diplomacy that were not necessarily as accessible to their male counterparts.</p>



<p>Prosopography can also help us redraw some of the maps of the region in the period. By systematically mapping out who was where, when, we get a better picture of where conflict zones actually were and the stability (or not) of control of different regions. The ancient Armenian capital of Ani was a particular political ping-pong ball, for example, but despite this, few maps of the period even show it as being near a ‘border’, preferring to map out the outer extent of places that were nominally captured at some point rather than taking a descriptive approach. The approach of doing political maps at “high points”, and showing them as consisting of matched borders in the manner of a modern country, can sometimes obscure as much as it tells us about the norms of a particular period.</p>

Note how most of those blue dots are well inside the kingdom&#8217;s &#8220;border&#8221; on the left.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, prosopography can help us sort and cross-check our own ideas: structured data created from chronicles isn’t an ‘accurate model of the past’, but it can be an accurate model of our best assessments and estimates, and so we can check it for internal consistency. By connecting together a set of dates and other bits of time-span data (e.g. X happened 1 year after Y), we can actually check mechanically what the things we said about one event imply about the dating of <em>every other event in the data</em>, reducing a problem that could take days of manual calculation into a button-press. This, in turn, can identify problems or places where certain ideas don’t fit together – for example, the Orbelis’ aforementioned rebellion is presented in the family chronicle with some passages about a member of the family going to see Atabeg Eldiguz to ask for his support against Giorgi. The slight problem here is that Eldiguz is generally held to have died three years before the conventional date of the rebellion, which is the sort of thing that a computer is very good at pulling out of a set of rather tangled data and this can then lead onto some interesting reassessments of who was actually dealing with who, and when, and what that might mean for the politics of a particular situation more widely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Models of the Past</h2>



<p>In many ways, I hope not too many people reading this will be asking why this all matters. As part of the <em>ACOUP </em>readership, you probably find the back and forth of medieval politics interesting for its own sake. Nonetheless, I think it does matter much more widely, and I’d like to finish by talking a bit about why.</p>



<p>For the Caucasus, medieval prosopography matters because <strong>people understand who they are and who they ought to be firmly in relation to their past</strong>. Georgian politicians evoke David the Builder in speeches to claim him for their political brand, Tamar is brought up in political debates over gender and gendered violence in the country, and the Georgian government is funding a literal computer game about the battle of Didgori in an attempt to inspire national sentiment among the young.<span id='easy-footnote-5-16352' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/09/meet-a-historian-james-baillie-on-digital-humanities-and-the-medieval-caucasus/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-16352' title='There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKB0aMwlwJI&quot;&gt;a trailer&lt;/a&gt;! It does not look entirely promising.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>  The strong connection between these figures and national and ethnic status makes having serious, at times difficult discussions about their very complex realities more important. A simplistic understanding of the past can mean a simplistic understanding of the present that is assumed to flow from it – and that, all too easily, can turn into a simplistic case for violence when ownership of the past is applied to ownership of culture and land.</p>



<p>Even if you’re not at all interested in the Caucasus region, though, you should care about prosopography for more or less the same reasons. How we fit the world into boxes matters, because those boxes then affect our thinking and decisions on a wide range of issues. In your own view of the world, who is part of what group? How do you assign them to that, and what can you or can you not imply about them on that basis? How do you take account of the overlaps, layers, and complications? How you handle all of these things is partly determined by the mental structures you use to understand particular aspects of the world: those sets of ideas about what information about people can look like then create particular ways that these pieces of information can fit together and can be processed.</p>



<p>What we should realise from this is that <strong>a data structure or a block of code are things that make implicit and subjective arguments about how to see the world</strong>. This is possibly the single most important basic insight that Digital Humanities as a field needs to impart, because it affects so much of the world around us. We live in an age where people are structuring data about each other all the time, and often treating both the information and structures as statements of absolute fact. Taking a humanities eye to those structures can show code for what it is: it is not for nothing that we refer to programming <em>languages</em>: whilst a computer may not be able to discern subjectivity, that simply means that it takes the programmer’s position as factual, not that it gains some imagined freedom from the doubt of humanistic positions and enquiry.</p>



<p>We also live in an age where people are modelling worlds all the time – and I’ll finish there on a lighter note, which is that I think this sort of data and modelling work can offer a tremendous amount when it comes to areas like game development and digital storytelling. I’ve been developing mods and computer games as a hobbyist for some years – indeed, that’s where I learned the coding skills that I’ve more recently used to put together my research database and the custom-built editing tools I use for it. This is an area where, by thinking about and playing with the data structures that tell us who characters are and how they relate to one another, we can create characters and social-political game elements that utilise those connections, and provide the depth that comes from people having complex, tense, overlapping identities and networks that change over time.</p>



<p>This has been a whistle-stop tour through two-and-a-bit sub-fields of history, and is definitely here only to give a flavour rather than the full drink. I hope, though, that this has taken you through some of the processes of digital humanities scholarship, given you a few glimpses into the lives of some fascinating people, and made a little of the case for this work and what it can bring us. Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Welcome back!  We are back from our November hiatus and thus back to regular weekly posts!  This week we&#8217;re going to answer the runner-up question in the last ACOUP Senate poll (polls in which you too can vote if you become a <em>pater aut mater conscriptus</em> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">via Patreon</a>).  The question, posed in two different ways by Tristan and DW Rowlands was &#8220;<strong>what made Roman Egypt such an unusual part of the Roman world?</strong>&#8220;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/03/26/fireside-friday-march-26-2021-on-the-nature-of-ancient-evidence/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/03/26/fireside-friday-march-26-2021-on-the-nature-of-ancient-evidence/">quite </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/07/23/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-iv-the-color-of-purple/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/07/23/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-iv-the-color-of-purple/">a few</a> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/28/collections-rome-decline-and-fall-part-ii-institutions/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/28/collections-rome-decline-and-fall-part-ii-institutions/">times </a>here that Roman Egypt is a perplexing part of understanding the Roman Empire because on the one hand it provides a lot of really valuable evidence for daily life concerns (mortality, nuptiality, military pay, customs and tax systems, etc.) but on the other hand it is always very difficult to know to what degree that information can be generalized because Roman Egypt is such an atypical Roman province.  So this week we&#8217;re going to look in quite general terms at what makes Egypt such an unusual place in the Roman world.  As we&#8217;ll see, some of the ways in which Egypt is unusual are Roman creations, but many of them stretch back before the Roman period in Egypt or indeed before the Roman period <em>anywhere</em>.</p>

<p>(Bibliography note: Because the evidence from Egypt is so ample, there is a lot of scholarship focused on it, both on the evidence itself and also speaking to the question of how typical that evidence might be.  I am not an Egypt specialist (at some point I&#8217;d love to get some of the Egypt specialists I do know to come here and chat about it), so this bibliography is only going to hit the high-points, as it were.  On Roman Egypt generally, I think C. Riggs (ed.), <em>The Oxford Handbook of Roman Egypt</em> (2012) is an excellent starting point.  Note also for a developmental history, R.S. Bagnall, <em>Roman Egypt: A History</em> (2021), L. Capponi, <em>Roman Egypt</em> (2011), L. Capponi, <em>Augustan Egypt: The Creation of a Roman Province </em>(2005) and A. Monson, <em>From the Ptolemies to the Romans: Political and Economic Change in Egypt</em> (2012).  On the demography of Roman Egypt, see R.S. Bagnall and B.W. Frier, <em>The Demography of Roman Egypt </em>(2010) as well as W. Scheidel, <em>Death on the Nile: Disease and the Demography of Roman Egypt </em>(2001).  On the military-social footprint in pre-Roman (that is, Ptolemaic) Egypt, see P. Johstono, <em>The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2020), and C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2014).  On the question of the &#8216;typicality&#8217; of Roman Egypt itself, see also D. Rathbone, &#8220;The Romanity of Roman Egypt: A Faltering Consensus?&#8221; <em>Journal of Juristic Papyrology</em> 43 (2013): 73-91, which is in turn responding to N. Lewis, &#8220;The Romanity of Roman Egypt: a growing consensus,&#8221; <em>Atti del XVII Congresso Internazionale di Papirologia</em> (1984).   As I think this bibliographic selection shows, this is a debate that is still very much ongoing &#8211; the consensus, while narrowing is not narrow but very much contested.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Makes Roman Egypt So Valuable To Historians?</h2>



<p>I should start by noting that Roman Egypt is not necessarily the only &#8216;strange&#8217; place in the Roman Empire.  Italy, of course, was a unique sort of place on the Roman Empire, but so was Roman Britain &#8211; conquered late and less fully urbanized than much of the empire (Dacia, held even more briefly, has the same set of problems).  I think Egypt is still probably the <em>oddest</em> large region in the Roman world, but it is not the only stand out. </p>



<p><strong>Instead what makes Roman Egypt&#8217;s uniqueness so important is one of the unique things about it: Roman Egypt preserves a much larger slice of our evidence than any other place in the ancient world</strong>.  This comes down to climate (as do most things); Egypt is a climatically extreme place.  On the one hand, most of the country is desert and here I mean <em>hard</em> desert, with absolutely minuscule amounts of precipitation.  On the other hand, the Nile River creates a fertile, at points almost lush, band cutting through the country running to the coast.  The change between these two environments is extremely stark; it is, I have been told (I haven&#8217;t yet been to Egypt), entirely possible in many places to stand with one foot in the &#8216;green&#8217; and another foot in the hard desert.</p>

<p>That in turn matters because while Egypt was hardly the only arid region Rome controlled, it was the only place you were likely to find very many large settlements and lots of people living in such close proximity to such extremely arid environments (other large North African settlements tend to be coastal).  And <em>that</em> in turn matters for preservation.  When objects are deposited &#8211; lost, thrown away, carefully placed in a sanctuary, whatever &#8211; they begin to degrade.  Organic objects (textile, leather, <em>paper</em>, wood) rot as microorganisms use them as food, while metal objects oxidize (that is, rust).<span id='easy-footnote-1-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16240' title='Stone is the big exception.  People often assume that the ancients built everything in stone, which is really quite wrong: stone was a very expensive building material only used for the most important buildings.  However all of the buildings made in wood, mudbrick, thatch and other perishable materials long since vanished (even brick tends to crumble much faster than stone), leaving only the stone buildings behind, a classic case of survivorship bias.  Always be suspicious of &amp;#8216;they don&amp;#8217;t make &amp;#8217;em like they used to&amp;#8217; really meaning &amp;#8216;only the very highest quality products from the past tend to survive to the present.&amp;#8217;'><sup>1</sup></a></span>  Aridity arrests (at least somewhat) both processes.  Consequently things <em>survive</em> from the Roman period (or indeed, from even more ancient periods) in Egypt that simply wouldn&#8217;t survive almost anywhere else.</p>



<p>By far the most important of those things is <em>paper</em>, particularly papyrus paper.  The Romans actually had a number of writing solutions.  For short-term documents, they used wax writing tablets, an ancient sort of &#8216;dry erase board&#8217; which could be scraped smooth to write a new text when needed; these only survive under very unusual circumstances.  For more permanent documents, wood and papyrus were used.  Wood tablets, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets">such as those famously recovered from the Roman fort at Vindolanda</a>, are fairly simple: thin wooden slats are smoothed so they can be written on with link and a pen, creating a rigid but workable and cheap writing surface; when we find these tablets they have tended to be short documents like letters or temporary lists, presumably in part because storing lots of wood tablets would be hard so more serious records would go on the easier to store papyrus paper.</p>



<p><strong>Papyrus paper was lighter, more portable, more storeable option.</strong>  Papyrus paper is produced by taking the pith of the papyrus plant, which is sticky, and placing it in two layers at right angles to each other, before compressing (or crushing) those layers together to produce a single sheet, which is then dried, creating a sheet of paper (albeit a very fibery sort of paper, as you can see).  Papyrus paper originated in Egypt and the papyrus plant is native to Egypt, but by the Roman period we generally suppose papyrus paper to have been used widely over much of the Roman Empire; it is sometimes supposed that papyrus was cheaper and more commonly used in Egypt than elsewhere, but it is hard to be sure.</p>

<p>Now within the typical European and Mediterranean humidity, papyrus doesn&#8217;t last forever (unlike the parchment paper produced in the Middle Ages which was far more expensive but also lasts much longer); papyrus paper will degrade over anything from a few decades to a couple hundred years &#8211; the more humidity, the faster decay.  Of course wood tablets and wax tablets fare no better.  What that means is that in most parts of the Roman Empire, very little casual writing survives; what <em>does</em> survive were the sorts of important official documents which might be inscribed on stone (along with the literary works that were worth painstakingly copying over and over again by hand through the Middle Ages).  But letters, receipts, tax returns, census records, shopping lists, school assignments &#8211; these sorts of documents were all written on less durable materials which don&#8217;t survive except in a few exceptional sites like Vindolanda.</p>



<p>Or Egypt.  Not individual places in Egypt; pretty much the whole province.</p>



<p>In the extremely dry conditions of the Egyptian desert, papyrus can survive (albeit typically in damaged scraps rather than complete scrolls) from antiquity to the present.  Now the coverage of these surviving papyri is not even.  The Roman period is far better represented in the surviving papyri than the Ptolemaic period (much less the proceeding &#8216;late&#8217; period or the New Kingdom before that).  It&#8217;s also not evenly distributed geographically; the Arsinoite nome (what is today el-Fayyum, an oasis basin to the West of the Nile) and the Oxyrhynchus nome (roughly in the middle of Egypt, on the Nile) are both substantially overrepresented, while the Nile Delta itself has fewer (but by no means zero) finds.  Consequently, we need to be worried not only about the degree to which Egypt might be representative of the larger Roman world, but also the degree to which these two nomes (a nome is an administrative district within Egypt, we&#8217;ll talk about them more in a bit) are representative of Egypt.  That&#8217;s complicated in turn by the fact that the Arsinoite nome is not a normal nome; extensive cultivation there only really begins under Ptolemaic rule, which raises questions about how typical it was.  It also means we lack a really good trove of papyri from a nome in Lower Egypt proper (the northern part of the country, covering the delta of the Nile) which, because of its different terrain, we might imagine was in some ways different.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it is difficult to overstate the value of the papyri we do recover from Egypt.  Documents containing census and tax information can give us important clues about the structure of ancient households (revealing, for instance, a lot of complex composite households).  Tax receipts (particularly for customs taxes) can illuminate a lot about how Roman customs taxes (<em>portoria</em>) were assessed and conducted.  Military pay stubs from Roman Egypt also provide the foundation for our understanding of how Roman soldiers were paid, recording for instance, pay deductions for rations, clothes and gear.  We also occasionally recover fragments of literary works that we know existed but which otherwise did not survive to the present.  And there is <em>so much</em> of this material.  Whereas new additions to the corpus of ancient literary texts are extremely infrequent (the last very long such text was the recovery of the <em>Athenaion Polteia</em> or <em>Constitution of the Athenians</em>, from a papyrus discovered in the Fayyum (of course), published in 1891), the quantity of unpublished papyri from Egypt remains vast and there is frankly a real shortage of trained Egyptologists who can work through and publish this material (to the point that the vast troves of unpublished material<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Obbink" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Obbink"> has created deeply unfortunate opportunities for theft and fraud</a>).</p>

The discovery of a fragment of this work on papyrus discovered in 1879.  The information it offers on the structure of government in Athens is invaluable.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>And so that is the first way in which Egypt is unusual: we know a <em>lot</em> more about daily life in Roman Egypt, especially when it comes to affairs <em>below</em> the upper-tier of society</strong>.  Recovered papyrological evidence makes petty government officials, regular soldiers, small farming households, affluent &#8216;middle class&#8217; families and so on much more visible to us.  But of course that immediately raises debates over how typical those people we can see are, because we&#8217;d <em>like</em> to be able to generalize information we learn about small farmers or petty government officials more broadly around the empire, to use that information to &#8216;fill in&#8217; regions where the evidence just does not survive.  But of course the rejoinder is natural to point out the ways in which Egypt may be <em>unusual</em> beyond merely the survival of evidence (to include the possibility that cheaper papyrus in Egypt may have meant that more things were committed to paper here than elsewhere).</p>



<p>Consequently the <em>debate</em> about how strange a place Roman Egypt was is also a fairly important and active area of scholarship.  We can divide those arguments into two large categories: the way in which Roman rule <em>itself</em> in Egypt was unusual and the ways in which Egypt was a potentially unusual place <em>in comparison to the rest of Roman world</em> already.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Romans Made Egypt Unusual</h2>



<p>When it comes to Roman governance in Egypt, perhaps the best summary of what we know about how typical it was would be to say that Roman rule in Egypt was somewhat unusual, but rather less unusual than we used to think it was, and it become more typical over time (so the level of unusualness is greatest under Augustus and then declines as a factor of time).  Ironically, it has been in no small part coming to understand the wealth of the papyrus evidence that has led to this shift, revealing that our literary sources sometimes <em>overstated</em> the degree to which Egypt was unusual.</p>



<p>A lot of that comes from how Tacitus represents the structure of Roman rule in Egypt: he describes Augustus as having &#8216;kept in the [imperial] house&#8217; (<em>retinere domi</em>) the governance of Egypt, assigning it to an equestrian<span id='easy-footnote-2-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16240' title='A member of Rome&amp;#8217;s economic elite (the &lt;em&gt;ordo equester&lt;/em&gt; or equestrian class) who did not have an independent political career (which would confer membership in the Senate and thus the &lt;em&gt;ordo Senatus&lt;/em&gt; in the imperial period).  Emperors often employed officials drawn from the &lt;em&gt;equites&lt;/em&gt; in various key bureaucratic positions which would either be beneath the dignity of a senator (being functionally secretarial in nature) or which would be too politically sensitive for a senator (who might be a potential political rival for an emperor).'><sup>2</sup></a></span> prefect.<span id='easy-footnote-3-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16240' title='In contrast to a provincial governor, who would have been a proconsul or propraetor in the provinces still controlled directly by the senate, or by a legatus Augusti in provinces controlled directly by the emperor (most of the provinces with meaningful military forces).  Both pro-magistrates and legati were drawn from the members of the Senate who thus kept their traditional perogative of being Rome&amp;#8217;s governors and army commanders, even under the empire.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>  Egypt was a relatively late addition to Rome&#8217;s growing Empire; the Ptolemaic dynasty had ruled it since the death of Alexander the Great in 323.  From the 160s that Ptolemaic kingdom had become effectively a client of Rome, its independence maintained by the threat of Roman arms (demonstrated vividly in 168 when Rome turned back a Seleucid invasion of Egypt with noting more than a <em>consultum</em> of the Senate), but had remained independent until Cleopatra&#8217;s disasterous decision to back Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) in the last phase of Rome&#8217;s civil war.  After their defeat, Octavian (soon to be Augustus) had in 30 BC after the suicide of Cleopatra, annexed the kingdom, creating the province of Roman Egypt.</p>



<p>Tacitus&#8217; description of Augustus keeping the rule of Egypt &#8216;in the house&#8217; led early scholars to assume that Egypt was taken essentially as the private property of the emperors.  This is less crazy than it initially sounds; later emperors administered massive estates through a parallel state treasury called the <em>fiscus</em> (distinct from the main treasury of the Roman state, the <em>aerarium Saturni</em>; the <em>fiscus</em> was the private accoutns and property of the emperor) administered in some cases by equestrian officials, so the idea of running an entire province effectively out of the <em>fiscus</em>, with the whole of Egypt effectively the private property of the emperor administered by an equestrian official wouldn&#8217;t have seemed impossible and it certainly seems to be what Tacitus is describing.</p>



<p>But as our evidence for the activity of these prefects has improved, what we see are officials who act quite a lot like other provincial governors, despite their non-senatorial origins.  <em>Praefecti Aegpyti</em> typically served around three years (fairly typical), where generally not from the province they oversaw (also typical), and wouldn&#8217;t be reassigned to a post back in that province (also typical).  Unlike with the earlier Ptolemaic government, there was no royal court in Egypt, the prefect&#8217;s entourage more nearly resembling that of a Roman governor, nor was the emperor personally present.  Residents of Egypt who wished to petition the emperor had to do it through the same channels as any other resident of the Roman Empire.  The military enforcement forces in the province, too, were typically Roman, drawn (as was normal) from provinces other than where they served.  Consequently, as Dominic Rathbone (<em>op. cit.</em>) notes, local elites looking to operate with this new form of government found that they had to adjust themselves to a <em>system</em> of rule, quintessentially Roman, rather than the more personalistic Ptolemaic regime where favor might be curried with important local figures or the royal court itself.</p>



<p>That said, while we&#8217;ve increasingly found that the <em>Praefectus Aegypti</em> was more of a normal governor than we thought, vision into the lower levels of the Roman administration in Egypt reveal a complex and in some cases peculiar system.  In most of the Roman Empire, Roman governors oversaw largely self-governing communities, run by local elites, which handled most local affairs.  Those communities generally delegated governing functions to elected or appointed magistrates who were amateur part-timers drawn from the elite (the <em>curiales</em>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/28/collections-rome-decline-and-fall-part-ii-institutions/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/28/collections-rome-decline-and-fall-part-ii-institutions/">we&#8217;ve mentioned these fellows before</a>).</p>



<p>In Egypt, by contrast, while the Romans disassembled the royal Ptolemaic court, <strong>they initially seem to have left much of its administrative apparatus of salaries administrators in place</strong>. The division of Egypt into administrative districts &#8211; called nomes &#8211; was kept and the seat of government in the province was firmly entrenched in Alexandria (whereas at least in the first two centuries, most Roman provinces had no clearly established &#8216;capital&#8217;).  Each of the nomes was governed by a <em>strategos</em> (while the word means &#8216;general&#8217; these were purely civilian officials), typically drawn from the Alexandrian upper-class (rather than being truly <em>local</em> elites), assisted by a salaried <em>basilikos grammateus</em>, &#8216;royal scribe.&#8217;  Villages also generally had a <em>komogrammateus</em>, village scribe, who reported to the <em>strategos</em>; these fellows <em>also</em> seem to have initially been salaried officials.<span id='easy-footnote-4-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16240' title='on this, see Rathbone, &lt;em&gt;op. cit.&lt;/em&gt; 84-5.  There is considerable uncertainty as to if these lower level officials, often casually &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8216;liturgists&amp;#8217; but where we do not necessarily &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; their jobs were liturgic (that is, assigned to specific rich-people in a non-voluntary way of devolving state action on the wealthy).'><sup>4</sup></a></span>  Some of these positions gradually became truly liturgic in nature, mirroring more closely systems of local governance in much of the rest of the Roman world, but perhaps only in the late second century.</p>



<p>Similarly, it was often assumed early on that land ownership and tenure would look very different with the emperor maintaining a lot of direct control and nearly all of the land in Egypt being effectively public land.  That perspective was potentially reinforced by the evidence out of the Arsinoite nome (again, modern el-Fayyum) because most of the land there under the Ptolemies belonged to military settlers and thus had special obligations placed on it and was thus not truly private land.  But what we see under the Romans is that first this military settler (cleruchic or katoikic; the distinctions here are a post for another day) land is fully privatized and taxed like it would be anywhere else.  Meanwhile, the evidence from the other nomes on the Nile itself suggest that private land was more common there even under the Ptolemies.  That said, the expansion of private land holdings seems to have been a <em>process</em> taking place mostly under Roman rule, which in turn meant that in many cases land tenure might look quite different in Egypt (where much land was either public or held by temples) than in the rest of the empire where most land was in private hands (although public and temple lands were also common), though it tended to look more and more like the rest of the empire over time, with the process supposed to be substantially complete by the end of the second century.  Scholars broadly seem to still be very much divided on the degree to which late Ptolemaic and early Roman Egyptian landholding was exceptional, but it certainly had its substantial quirks.</p>



<p><strong>Meanwhile the Romans did another odd thing in that they didn&#8217;t change: the currency system.  </strong>While the Roman Empire minted its currency in a series of regional mints (not centrally), the Romans almost always brought new areas under their control into the existing Roman currency system (based principally around the gold <em>aureus</em>, the silver <em>denarius</em> and the copper-alloy <em>sestertius</em>).  That was both a tool of Roman imperialism, a way to make physical Rome&#8217;s notional dominion over conquered lands, but it also served (probably unintentionally) to lower transaction costs and encourage economic interaction between provinces.  <strong>But Egypt was not brought into the Roman currency system</strong>, instead maintaining the Ptolemaic currency system based on the silver <em>tetradrachma</em> (Egypt was already a very monetized economy under the Ptolemies).  That barrier between the economy in Egypt and outside of it can make it tricky to know how representative prices within Roman Egypt were for the rest of the empire.  Egypt is only brought into the broader Roman currency system with the currency &#8216;reforms&#8217; of Diocletian (r. 284-305)</p>



<p>At the same time, Egypt was hardly &#8216;cut off&#8217; from the broader Roman economy.  We have good evidence of quite a lot of trade out of Egypt, particularly in agricultural staples.  But here again, Egypt is strange: Egyptian grain was the foundation for the imperial era <em>annona civilis</em>, the distribution of free grain to select citizens in the city of Rome itself.  That meant a massive, continuous state-organized transfer of grain, specifically wheat grain, from Egypt to Rome.  Some of that grain was taxed in kind, but much of it seems to have been purchased in Egypt; in either case transport was essentially subcontracted by the state.  Egypt was hardly the only source of grain for the <em>annona</em> (the province of Africa, modern Tunisia, was another major source), but few provinces likely saw the <em>scale</em> of state-organized goods transfer that Egypt did.  And it&#8217;s striking that attested Egyptian agriculture is quite heavily dominated by wheat farming, rather more than we might normally expect, which both speak to the high yields the Nile could offer but also Egypt&#8217;s role as the breadbasket of the Roman Empire.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But Egypt Was Already Unusual</h2>



<p>At the same time, there are some ways in which Egypt was, or at least we might supposed Egypt to have been, a unique place quite apart from the governmental structures imposed upon it, especially with regard to the rest of the Roman world.</p>



<p>A big part of this has to do with the Nile and the structure of agriculture it creates.  Most of the Roman world was reliant on rainfall agriculture, meaning that the all-important moisture which sustained the crops was from rain.  This might be supplemented in some cases either by dry-farming techniques (methods of retaining moisture in the soil in areas where rainfall is lower) or by limited irrigation from rivers and streams, but even a cursory glance at Roman agricultural writers (or earlier Greek ones) reveal a focus on the tremendous impact of rainfall on agricultural productivity.  And just about everywhere Rome went, that was the system they encountered.</p>



<p>But in Egypt, agriculture is entirely oriented around the Nile; rainfall is functionally a non-factor in ancient Egyptian agriculture.  Egypt&#8217;s agricultural season was based on that flooding with three seasons, first the flood (Akhet) when the Nile rose and inundated the fields, providing not only the necessary moisture (where water might be channeled and retained using systems of irrigation canals and levies) but also deposited a fresh layer of nutrient-rich silt.  Then the next season is Peret, when planting and growing would take place (generally in winter), then followed by the harvest (Shemu) before the cycle repeated again.</p>



<p>This sort of river-valley agriculture wasn&#8217;t rare globally; Mesopotamian agriculture worked similarly (albeit with less regular and more destructive flooding), but within the Roman Empire &#8211; which despite occasionally <em>extremely</em> optimistic maps you may see, did not include any meaningful amount of Mesopotamia proper &#8211; this sort of agriculture was rare.  <strong>First, it is clear that Egyptian agricultural yields (understood as either production-per-unit-land-area or production-per-unit-seed-sown) were generally higher than what we think to have been the norm for much of the Roman world</strong>.  While arguments about yields in Italy and Greece tend to suggest ranges between 4:1<span id='easy-footnote-5-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-16240' title='These are seed yields, so for every 1 unit of seeds sown (typically measured in dry volume), four units are harvested.'><sup>5</sup></a></span> and perhaps 8:1, while as Erdkamp<span id='easy-footnote-6-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-16240' title='P. Erdkamp, &lt;em&gt;The Grain Market in the Roman Empire&lt;/em&gt; (2005), 44-5.'><sup>6</sup></a></span> notes yields in Egypt seem to have been <em>much</em> higher.  Some tax evidence we have suggests normal yields in excess of 16:1 and tax rates high enough that at 7:1 &#8211; a <em>good</em> yield in Italy &#8211; a farmer would be swiftly taxed into starvation.  Consequently, it seems like agriculture in Egypt was always substantially more productive than rainfall agriculture in the rest of the Roman Empire.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, river-based agriculture also requires different capital investments: it has to be irrigated through systems of ditches and canals to actually get the water to the fields.  This is something that was crucial in Egyptian agriculture but often doesn&#8217;t make it into popular representations (e.g. games like <em>Children of the Nile</em> (2008), where the flood is important, but the player cannot do anything to shape or channel it), but was extremely important for agriculture around the Nile.  Irrigation channels could direct waters towards fields and away from flooding settlements.  That mattered because water exposure mattered and indeed a set of tax categories were established based on the water exposure of land: land which had not been flooded for some time was considered inferior (and exempt from taxes), while land which flooded entirely or required extensive irrigation to flood was taxed at lower rates.<span id='easy-footnote-7-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-16240' title='This is discussed by K. Blouin in C. Riggs, &lt;em&gt;op. cit.&lt;/em&gt;)'><sup>7</sup></a></span>  Those irrigation systems in turn had to be maintained, representing a form of capital investment &#8211; with <em>substantial</em> labor demands in construction and upkeep &#8211; that is much rarer in rainfall agriculture systems.  Whereas in ancient Mesopotamia this seems to have been organized by the state, my sense is that irrigation direction in Egypt happened more locally, but I confess I&#8217;ve found it hard to find a direct discussion of the matter.</p>

Note the presence of water in the scene; presumably these gardens (by which is meant vegetable gardens, not pleasure gardens) were either irrigated or flooded naturally with the rising of the river.  Of course we should note that agricultural practices in Egypt did change over time; this is not necessarily what a Roman-period farm would have looked like.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Both those labor demands and the high agricultural productivity around the Nile led in turn to what seem to have been &#8211; given the limits of the evidence &#8211; substantially higher population density in Egypt than in most other Mediterranean regions.  We generally suppose the population of Ptolemaic Egypt to have been <em>roughly </em>equivalent to that of Roman Italy, between five and seven million or so.  But in Egypt, almost all of those people were living directly along the Nile, on that green strip of land, a dramatically smaller and more contiguous area of settlement than what we see in, say, Roman Italy, much less more sparsely populated provinces like Spain or Gaul.</p>



<p><strong>And that in turn is tricky because <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/" data-type="post" data-id="3822">as we&#8217;ve discussed</a>, family formation patterns, disease and mortality and lots of other key demographic variables are subject to variation based on settlement patterns and agriculture</strong>.  We have a <em>lot</em> of data about age distribution, family size, marriage ages and so on from Roman Egypt, but demonstrating that, with its higher yields and higher population density &#8211; as a consequence of its unique climate &#8211; that these were <em>typical</em> in the Mediterranean is tricky.  That said it&#8217;s not impossible either and some scholars have made careers out of demonstrating the applicability of just such extrapolations (Bruce Frier comes immediately to mind).  But one must tread with caution.</p>



<p>And then there is the other major fact about Egypt: <strong>Egypt is really, really, <em>really</em></strong> <em><strong>old</strong></em>.  A quick set of date comparisons between Italy and Egypt can make the point.  Farming is arrives in Egypt c. 9,000 BC; in Italy that&#8217;s c. 6,000 BC (please note those &#8216;c.&#8217; <em>circa</em> indicators are doing a lot of work here).  By 4,000 BC in Egypt we&#8217;re starting to see the emergence of cities; we won&#8217;t see serious urbanism in Italy until the early-to-mid first millennium BC.  By 3,000 BC, Egypt is organized into a single state, with large urban administrative centers; Italy&#8217;s unification under the Romans won&#8217;t happen until the 270s BC.</p>



<p>Or as I put it to my students,<strong> it is the case that the Pyramids (constructed c. 2670-2400) were about as old to Cleopatra and Caesar as Cleopatra and Caesar are to us now</strong> (in fact, if you do the math, the Pyramids were a little older).  Now that huge sweep of time should caution us against the sort of &#8216;eternal Egypt&#8217; assumptions; Egypt in 2300BC was a very different Egypt than the Egypt of 230 or 23 BC. </p>



<p>But it also means we have to be aware that settlement and urbanism in Egypt were long, long settled before the Romans showed up.  That&#8217;s actually a fairly large contrast to many areas in the Roman Empire (particularly in its western half), where the Romans were themselves a key impetus towards the development of substantial urbanism (although it is important not to overstate this; in a lot of cases Roman rule is causing cities to emerge in societies that already had modest towns.  And of course in North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, urbanism was long established.)</p>



<p>At the same time Egypt was ruled from 323 to 31BC by members of the Macedonian Ptolemaic (or Lagid) family, beginning with Ptolemy I Soter, one of the companions of Alexander the Great.  Ptolemaic rule itself brought changes to Egypt, many of which persisted into the Roman period.  Not the least of this was the establishment and aggrandizement of the Ptolemaic capital of Alexandria, which would remain the political center of the province under the Romans.  Ptolemaic pharaohs also encouraged a degree of religious syncretism, particularly through the cult of the god Serapis, though the Greek and Egyptian upper-classes remained largely distinct and non-intermixed under the Ptolemies (with the Greeks &#8216;in charge&#8217; as it were).  One of the impacts of Roman rule is the fairly quick fusion of these two elites now that both were subjects in empires that did not belong to them.</p>

Here Serapis is sculpted in Greek-style (which was typical of his depictions) but wearing one of his attributes on his head in Egyptian fashion, in this case what is likely a grain measure, signifying his role in providing abundance and agricultural fertility.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, the geography of Egypt has <em>tended</em> to somewhat isolate it from the broader Near East and the Mediterranean.  Now that word &#8216;tended&#8217; also does a lot of work because there was almost always significant connectivity between Egypt and the Mediterranean, but at the same time periods of political <em>unity</em> involving Egypt and regions beyond it are rare and generally fairly brief, such as periods of Assyrian (670-656), Persian (525-404, 343-332) or Roman rule (31BC-646AD),<span id='easy-footnote-8-16240' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/12/02/collections-why-roman-egypt-was-such-a-strange-province/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-16240' title='One of these things is not like the others.'><sup>8</sup></a></span> or of course the very brief period under Alexander before his empire fragmented.  </p>



<p>Now it&#8217;s important to be clear what I&#8217;m <em>not</em> saying here.  <strong>Older scholarship often posited a sort of culturally &#8216;eternal Egypt&#8217; which resisted the pressures of &#8216;Romanization&#8217; (itself now a contested term rarely used by scholars); that vision of a total lack of cultural exchange just doesn&#8217;t hold up to the evidence</strong>.  There is a <em>lot</em> of evidence for Roman cultural identity emerging in Roman Egypt as time went on (so more in the second and third centuries AD than the first).  And while Latin didn&#8217;t catch on, we do see in Roman Egypt a continuation of the process (starting under the Ptolemies) whereby Greek steadily seems to supplant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)">Egyptian Demotic</a>, bringing Egypt linguistically more into the broader Roman world.  <strong>Importantly, that means that Roman Egypt seems to have become a <em>less</em> unusual part of the Roman world as time went on</strong>.  On the flip side, those were processes which took much of the Roman period to occur.  In the meantime, Egypt was a place where Greek and Roman cultural elements coexisted with the worship of indigenous Egyptian divinities <em>millennia</em> older than <em>the city of Rome itself</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s certainly more we could talk about on this topic and I encourage anyone who wants to know more to browse the bibliography list at the beginning of this post.  We haven&#8217;t, for instance, talked too much here about the Roman Army in Egypt, in part because of the whole Roman apparatus, the army seems to have been by far the most broadly typical of Roman rule: the Roman army was famously (Polyb. 6.41.10-12) the Roman army wherever it went.  This is simply a very voluminous topic.</p>



<p>In no small part that&#8217;s because so much research into the Roman Empire makes use of Egyptian papyrus evidence and thus in turn has to address the degree to which that evidence can be generalized.  That means there are a <em>lot</em> of arguments over that question and I doubt that will change any time soon.  That said, it does seem to me that the scholarly consensus on the question of the &#8216;strangeness&#8217; of Roman Egypt is very slowly narrowing, as both Roman Egypt and also the rest of the Roman world slowly but surely become clearer to us as the body of published archaeological, epigraphic and papyrological evidence grows larger.  The great thing is that we are never left with a &#8216;useless&#8217; discovery: a fact about Roman Egypt which turns out not to be more broadly applicable to the rest of the Roman world is nevertheless something we&#8217;ve learned about Roman Egypt, which was itself an important and interesting place!</p>

<p><strong>This is going to be the last post, however, before my November break.  As I&#8217;ve noted before, I&#8217;m planning to take November as an <em>ACOUP</em>-sabbatical in order to make a concerted push on my book project</strong>; while I do balance blog-writing and research writing normally, sometimes it just helps to be able to focus singularly on a project for an extended period of time.  So that means that the <em>next</em> normal Friday post will be 12/2/2022.  Meanwhile to be fair to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">patrons </a>who are supporting this project, I will be posting some short sections of the book project for them <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">over on Patreon</a>.  If this break works out, I may make it an annual thing (though I&#8217;ll probably pick one of the summer months) along a similar set of lines.  But fear not, change not ye bookmarks, we will back back to our regular schedule in December; I&#8217;ve got a really cool guest post to share with you, along with a discussion of Roman Egypt and my own lukewarm takes on some of the worldbuilding in <em>Rings of Power</em> (also lest any of you fear that <em>ACOUP</em> is going to become an all-Paradox-all-the-time space; there will be more <em>Teaching Paradox</em> series, but probably not for a bit).<span id='easy-footnote-1-16136' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/28/fireside-friday-october-28-2022-the-book-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16136' title='But the next one is probably &lt;em&gt;Hearts of Iron&lt;/em&gt;.'><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Since I am taking the next month off of the blog to work on my book project, I thought this might be a good time to talk about my book project, outlining the questions I&#8217;m examining, the kind of research I&#8217;ve done and some of the conclusions I&#8217;ve come to in &#8216;elevator pitch&#8217; form (albeit for what seems to be a fairly tall building).</p>



<p>The one sentence version is: <strong>My book argues</strong><span id='easy-footnote-2-16136' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/28/fireside-friday-october-28-2022-the-book-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16136' title='Once I finish writing it.'><sup>2</sup></a></span> <strong>that Roman military success in the third and second centuries B.C. was a consequence of superior Roman mobilization systems rooted in Italian social institutions which expressed themselves in the form of a comprehensive mobilization advantage, both more men but also more expensive men, which I can in turn detect by looking at the evidence for the costs of fielding armies in the period, particularly the cost of equipment</strong>.  I didn&#8217;t say it was a <em>short</em> sentence.</p>



<p>First we need some necessary background; my project is focused on &#8220;the third and second centuries B.C.&#8221;  The Roman Republic functionally completed the conquest of peninsular Italy in 272 B.C. with the capture of Tarentum.  The peninsula was split between Roman territory (about 1/3 of the land area) and the territory of the <em>socii</em>, formally Rome&#8217;s allies but in practice subjugated communities required to send troops to Rome&#8217;s armies and denied any other foreign policy (but internally self-governing).  Then in 264, Rome got itself into a scrap over a small town in Sicily (Messina) which then blew up into a major war with Carthage.  That war would trigger a chain of other wars, driven in part by Rome&#8217;s belligerence and in part by the also considerable belligerence of every <em>other</em> large Mediterranean state.  Rome thus would enter a series of wars against the Carthaginians (the Punic Wars), the Antigonid kingdom of Macedon (the Macedonian Wars), one war against the Seleucid kingdom (which ruled much of the Middle East), along with literally dozens of smaller conflicts in Spain, the Balkans, Cisalpine Gaul (today Northern Italy) and Transalpine Gaul (today Southern France).  By 133, the Roman Republic was the unquestioned master of the Mediterranean, having destroyed or humbled all of these rivals &#8211; in such a position that a Roman tribune (Tiberius Gracchus) could disestablish a major kingdom (that of Pergamum) simply by passing a law in Rome.  <strong>It is this range, from 264 to 133, a sort of &#8216;long second century&#8217; where Roman dominance comes into being that is my focus.</strong></p>



<p>Naturally the question of how Rome was able to effectively run the table, overturning the entire Mediterranean state system in just a century and a half or so, is an important one.  Traditionally, scholars have pointed to some of the tremendous and outsized Roman mobilizations (especially in 216-214) and thus argued that &#8216;manpower&#8217; was the Roman secret: Rome had, in the words of Nicholas Sekunda, &#8220;horde after uncomplaining horde of Italian peasant manpower&#8221; to throw at its enemies.<span id='easy-footnote-3-16136' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/28/fireside-friday-october-28-2022-the-book-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16136' title='N. Sekunda, &amp;#8220;Hellenistic Warfare&amp;#8221; in &lt;em&gt;Warfare in the Ancient World&lt;/em&gt; ed. J. Hackett (1989).'><sup>3</sup></a></span>  You can see this focus animating some of the important foundational works in Roman demography for instance &#8211; the assumption being that if we could count Italian peasants, we could understand Rome&#8217;s success.<span id='easy-footnote-4-16136' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/28/fireside-friday-october-28-2022-the-book-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16136' title='Most notably here P.A. Brunt, &lt;em&gt;Italian Manpower&lt;/em&gt; (1971).'><sup>4</sup></a></span>  To put it kindly, this answer is not actually very helpful, because as we&#8217;ll see raw population &#8211; manpower in the most basic sense &#8211; was not the problem ancient states faced in mobilizing armies.  The more sophisticated studies of this sort instead focus on <em>mobilized</em> manpower; Michael Taylor has noted that Rome&#8217;s ability to mobilize manpower seems largely unconnected to its relatively weak state finance, for instance.<span id='easy-footnote-5-16136' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/28/fireside-friday-october-28-2022-the-book-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-16136' title='M. Taylor, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3eZW1UC&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://amzn.to/3eZW1UC&quot;&gt;Soldiers and Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2020).'><sup>5</sup></a></span>  But that just poses the question anew: why was Rome able to mobilize so much more manpower?  Evidently state finance wasn&#8217;t the answer, so what was?</p>



<p>It isn&#8217;t that the Romans just had more surplus manpower because, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/" data-type="post" data-id="3822">as we&#8217;ve noted here</a>, the nature of ancient agriculture meant that <em>everyone</em> had lots of surplus manpower, with small farms generating little surplus because they supported families that, as units of labor, were much too large for their tiny farms.  I work this out in the project with some modeling of &#8216;typical&#8217; smallholders, but the upshot is that the countryside was pretty much always going to be &#8216;long&#8217; on labor but short on agricultural (or other economic) surplus.  But you need that surplus to support a population of non-farmers, to provide their wages, equipment and so on.  The question was never finding a lot of farmers with not a lot to do (they were the <em>one</em> thing you had <em>a lot</em> of), the question was turning those farmers into soldiers, which was in turn about prying <em>resources</em>, not <em>people</em> out of the countryside.</p>



<p>And here is where my focus lies: the main constraint on raising armies were the costs of turning farmers into soldiers, but those costs were often <em>not</em> borne by the state.  At Rome, for instance, the Roman state paid only for the wages of Roman soldiers and the food of allied soldiers.  Roman soldiers had to pay for their food out of their wages and allied soldier&#8217;s wages were presumably paid by the community required to send them to Rome&#8217;s armies.  Both sets of troops had to pay for all of their own equipment (which for the wealthy might include a horse) out of pocket.  Consequently, as Taylor has demonstrated, measuring state finance isn&#8217;t a good way of getting at military power, because a lot of military spending wasn&#8217;t done by the state and so state expenditures are very poorly correlated to military strength or success.  Very wealthy states often struggled to field top-rate armies that could compete with Rome.</p>



<p>So in my research I set out to get a handle, as best I could, on the total cost of mobilizing soldiers in this period.  The approach had to be comparative rather than Rome-focused in order to be useful in understanding Rome&#8217;s advantage, so each method I applied to Roman mobilization, I had to apply &#8211; in as much as possible &#8211; to the systems of Rome&#8217;s rivals: Carthage, the three successor states (Antigonid Macedon, Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Anatolia+Syria+Mesopotamia; seriously, the Seleucid Empire was <em>big</em>), and Rome&#8217;s non-state foes (mostly focused on Spain and Gaul).  The goal here is to treat &#8216;total social cost&#8217; &#8211; that is the &#8216;all in&#8217; cost of a soldier <em>including</em> costs devolved onto the soldier himself or subordinated communities.</p>



<p>Now what the &#8216;manpower thesis&#8217; should lead us to expect is that Roman soldiers should be cheap and expendable; that would neatly explain how Rome managed to bounce back from some really nasty defeats in the third century, for instance.  What I found, however, was the reverse: Rome&#8217;s way of warfare seemed to be incredibly <em>materiel</em> <em>intense</em>; the Roman soldier was, man for man, the <em>most expensive</em> fellow on the battlefield, a stunning and unexpected conclusion, which is of course the best kind.</p>



<p>Some of these areas were well-studied enough that I could quickly survey what we knew and make comparisons.  Rome&#8217;s logistics, for instance, were expensive: Rome&#8217;s far-flung operations demanded that the Roman Republic ship grain across the Mediterranean to support campaigns (in addition to local <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/07/29/collections-logistics-how-did-they-do-it-part-ii-foraging/" data-type="post" data-id="14164">foraging</a>); the Roman Republic did skimp on paying its troops (but from this &#8216;total social investment&#8217; angle that just devolves the labor cost of service onto the soldiers), but it did not skimp on food.  Meanwhile, while the Romans sometimes have a modern reputation for not bringing much cavalry (always a very expensive arm, because horses are costly), in practice Roman armies were broadly typical in terms of the amount of war animals they brought to war; Roman cavalry <em>sucked</em>, but it wasn&#8217;t for not having enough of it.  We can also think about &#8216;quality&#8217; costs &#8211; what today would be training costs; here Roman rolling recruitment and continuous warfare meant that all Roman men of any property were going to spent quite a few years in the army.  That&#8217;s a cost too: keeping the soldiers out <em>doing something</em> which in turn created this deep well of trained (and equipped, see below) reserves in case of disaster or the need to open a second (third? fourth?) front.  Rome&#8217;s habit then of always having at least a couple of small wars going could be seen, I&#8217;d argue, as a significant investment in quality.</p>



<p>Instead the tricky part was <em><strong>equipment</strong></em>.  For non-battlefield equipment, developing a sufficient archaeological sample base was likely to be impossible in this period; we don&#8217;t have a really good sense of what stuff and how much Rome&#8217;s adversaries carried and identifying dual-use tools as military would be very difficult.<span id='easy-footnote-6-16136' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/28/fireside-friday-october-28-2022-the-book-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-16136' title='Easier in the Roman case where later forts and battles like the deposits at Kalkriese provide a good cross-section of Roman non-combat kit, but still very tricky.'><sup>6</sup></a></span>  That said our non-Roman sources, particularly Polybius and Josephus, are unanimous that the Romans marched <em>heavy</em>, with a quantity of heavy tools and building materials (for those fortified camps) that surprised contemporaries familiar with Greek and Macedonian styles of warfare (and they in turn tended to think the Carthaginians did less field fortification, implying that the Romans were heavier than the Greeks who were heavier than the Carthaginians when it came to non-combat materiel).</p>



<p>But <em><strong>battlefield equipment</strong></em> is rarely studied comparatively in this way and there was enough evidence to make a direct comparison of surviving archaeological exemplars.  Literary sources and representational evidence can give us a fairly good picture &#8211; there are some major uncertainties, but <em>fairly good</em> &#8211; of the equipment different kinds of soldiers and warriors carried for fighting.  We have almost no <em>price data</em> for this equipment; I cannot tell you how many <em>denarii</em> a good <em>gladius</em> cost because no ancient source records that.  But I could compare the material demands &#8211; iron, bronze, wood, leather, textile &#8211; and in some cases where modern time-and-labor studies had been done, the labor demands, of all of these elements of equipment.  I could then sort them into panoplies (complete sets of equipment for a sort of soldier) and then <strong>make a comparison of relative equipment cost between armies in the period</strong>.  That may sound simple in practice but doing this comparison means untangling a bunch of tricky questions about ancient equipment and bringing together a lot of archaeological evidence, so this comparison is the biggest evidentiary chunk of the project.</p>



<p>And what emerges from this, as I said, is that the Romans were anything but expendable: they were the most expensive kitted fellows out there.  The main quantitative comparative element ended up being worked metal (iron and bronze) because worked metal was <em>so expensive</em> compared to other materials, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/" data-type="post" data-id="3817">for reasons we&#8217;ve discussed here before</a>.  And the Romans wore a <em>lot of it</em>, 25% more than their nearest competitors, in fact.  Indeed just about everyone else&#8217;s kit seemed to look for any opportunity to substitute metal equipment for <em>something else</em> (like textile for armor, as in the <em>linothorax</em>).  Meanwhile the Romans went gangbusters with mail armor, a new defensive technology whose main drawback was that it was <em>very expensive</em>, being both made of lots of expensive iron but also demanding a very labor-intensive manufacturing process.  Initially worn by wealthy Romans, by the end of the period this became the <em>standard armor of the legions</em>, which is just wild.</p>



<p>So the Romans not only had <em>more</em> soldiers (when they needed them), but <em>more expensive </em>soldiers, whose superior combat performance was (I argue) connected in part to the fact that the Romans spared no expense in their equipment and kept lots of them in the field all the time.  That makes sense of course: Roman soldiers were buying <em>their own equipment</em> (we suspect, but cannot be sure, that some of Rome&#8217;s rivals state-issued at least some equipment) and so invested heavily in their own survival.  But this in turn means that Rome&#8217;s mobilizations were not just an issue of &#8216;manpower,&#8217; rather Rome <strong><em>comprehensively out-mobilized its rivals</em></strong> across a wide range of resources.</p>



<p>Which of course led into my second question, &#8220;how did they <em>do that</em>?&#8221;  There&#8217;s certainly no indication that it was because the Romans were particular rich; Rome was more urbanized and wealthier than its non-state rivals, but not (in so far as we can tell) compared to the Seleucids, the Carthaginians or the Ptolemies (the wealth of the latter two being proverbial at the time).  Instead it looked like Rome <em>dug deeper</em> rather than having a deeper well.  That led me to look at the recruitment and mobilization systems each of these groups used.</p>



<p>For the non-state peoples &#8211; the Gauls, Celtiberians, Iberians and so on &#8211; mobilization seems to have been very <em>intensive</em>, meaning they got a big percentage of their total available resources, but the lack of large-scale state organization meant that the pool of resources was small because these polities (tribes and chiefdoms, mostly) were small.  Recruitment was based on the social networks of &#8216;big men&#8217; &#8211; both horizontal and vertical elite relationships &#8211; or on ethnic or tribal solidarity; neither of which &#8216;scale up&#8217; well.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the other major <em>states</em> mostly relied on what I came to refer to as &#8216;engines of force.&#8217;  The core of the state was the army, which used its dominance to extract revenues from a subjugated population which was ethnically distinct (e.g. the Mesopotamian, Syrian or Egyptian subjects of Alexander&#8217;s Macedonian successors), which was then used to fund the continuation of that army.  Thus taxes were used to raise force and then that force was used to raise taxes and around and around the wheel spins.  But that system imposes a lot of administrative overhead and also demands that a lot of the troops it creates be held back to keep the engine running.  It also limits the ability to mobilize subject peoples because if you give these folks weapons, they might decide they shouldn&#8217;t pay taxes anymore (or that they deserve the same military pay as the Macedonians, a factor in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes#The_Egyptian_Revolt_(204%E2%80%93196_BC)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes#The_Egyptian_Revolt_(204%E2%80%93196_BC)">Great Revolt in Egypt of 205</a>).</p>



<p>The Roman system was different: it relied on what I&#8217;ve termed &#8216;willing compliance.&#8217;  There were dire penalties for draft dodging by Roman citizens and Rome interpreted any effort at the same by Rome&#8217;s &#8216;allies&#8217; as rebellion and responded with brutal force, but beyond that there were no real enforcement mechanisms.  Rome had one really big &#8216;stick&#8217; that was very costly and thus fairly rarely used, but that was it.  Rome had no bureaucratic presence among the socii and the Roman census which determined military service obligations was conducted more-or-less on the honor system.  <strong>Instead when it came time to raise an army (which was every year), the consuls put out a list of Romans who were drafted and sent messengers to all of the socii to tell them how many men to send and that was it.  And with a few exceptions, <em>that worked</em>, which is <em>wild</em> for a system of <em>extracting manpower from a disenfranchised subordinated populace</em></strong>; the men showed up, having purchased their own weapons, armor and tools (at considerable expense) and the Romans marched off to go crack some skulls.  The administrative overhead of this whole system was <em>minuscule</em>.</p>



<p>Now it&#8217;s not hard to see why the Romans would show up: this was <em>their</em> Republic, they were fighting under the command leaders <em>they</em> had elected in voting bodies that closely correlated liability for military service with voting.  But a little more than half of every Roman army was made up of <em>socii</em>; why did <em>they</em> dutifully show up more often than not?</p>



<p>What I argue is that the &#8216;secret&#8217; here is the structure of Rome&#8217;s alliance system; while it isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> an alliance, it also isn&#8217;t a one-way deal either.  The Romans themselves recognize this, repeatedly comparing the system to another social institution they shared with the other Italians: <em>clientela</em> (we&#8217;d say &#8216;patronage&#8217;), a system where by lower-status person could enter into a reciprocal relationship with a higher status person; the former would be expected to support his patron politically, while the patron was expected to protect their clients legally and economically.</p>



<p>The Roman alliance system in turn worked kind of like <em>clientela</em> between communities.  A community of the <em>socii</em>, as the junior partner, promised to serve in Rome&#8217;s armies and stick by the Romans in war.  Meanwhile Rome, as the senior partner, promised to protect the <em>socii</em> militarily and to let them have a share of the loot and glory of successful military action.  And Rome largely lived up to that bargain in this period.  And that helped foster allied &#8216;buy-in&#8217; for Rome; whereas being a client in some non-Italian cultures (e.g. the Greeks) was shameful, for the Romans and Italians being a &#8216;good client&#8217; could be a source of positive honor.  There was no shame in this relationship, which is really important for managing subordination in slavery-cultures where any <em>hint</em> of &#8216;slavishness&#8217; demands a violent response to protect honor.  In short this was a <em>good deal</em> for allied communities living in what was frankly a pretty &#8216;tough neighborhood&#8217; (so the security guarantee was valuable) and who might benefit from loot from Rome&#8217;s wars.  And crucially it was a good deal they could recognize, that they had a language for, which was was <em>valued in their culture</em>, just as it was in Rome.</p>



<p>That buy-in let Rome rely on &#8216;willing compliance&#8217; with the allies except in extreme cases, which in turn let them rely on each allied community to manage its own recruitment, under the direction of its own local leaders.  That essentially let Rome take it&#8217;s very <em>intensive</em> recruitment system and &#8216;franchise it out,&#8217; expanding the geographic, economic and demographic reach of the system without compromising its foundation in community solidarity and civic militarism.</p>



<p>Consequently, when Rome called, nearly all of Italy answered.  Even when Roman armies were defeated in the field (esp. 218-216), only a minority of the <em>socii</em> ever tried to break away; the majority remained with Rome.  The result was that Rome could <em>dig deep</em>, fielding armies that were heavily equipped and well-supplied, but also replaceable in a disaster.  It also enabled Rome &#8211; combined with a Republican political system that allowed functionally any senator to be given the command of an army and be expected to know what to do with it &#8211; to wage wars simultaneously on multiple fronts and even against multiple enemies.  After 216, the Romans spent the next several years with around a quarter of a million men under arms, fighting simultaneously in theaters in Northern, Central and Southern Italy, Sicily, Spain and eventually the Balkans and North Africa <em>and</em> maintaining an active naval presence the whole time.</p>



<p>It was a <em>spectacular </em>display of military resources, rooted in Rome&#8217;s clever utilization of Italian social and political institutions, mobilized through a freeholding farmer class willing to dig deep into their pockets to field the heaviest equipment in defense of communities (both Rome and the allies) they saw as their own.</p>



<p>In any case, that&#8217;s the book project!  Right now I&#8217;m working on getting enough revised chapters together to be able to put together a &#8216;pitch package&#8217; in January.  The joint annual meeting for the Society for Classical Studies and the Archaeological Institute of America (SCS/AIA, the biggest &#8216;ancient world&#8217; professional conference in North America; Jan 5-8), at which I&#8217;ll be presenting on some of this, should be ideal place to gauge the interest of some of the key academic presses.</p>

<p>On to <strong>Recommendations!</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t lead in with a bit of a self-plug of this <a href="https://endeavors.unc.edu/when-in-rome/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://endeavors.unc.edu/when-in-rome/">profile of my teaching and research over at <em>Endeavors</em></a>, UNC-Chapel Hill&#8217;s magazine for highlighting the work of UNC researchers (where I still have a research appointment that keeps me in things like library access that I need for this and other projects), written by one of my former students, <a href="https://twitter.com/renalisa14" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/renalisa14">Renata Schmidt</a>.</p>

I&#8217;d be remiss as a student of Richard Talbert if I didn&#8217;t also note that for those interested in reading about how the ancients understood geography, maps and their place in the world, you might check out R. Talbert, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3SIooET" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3SIooET">Rome&#8217;s World: The Peutinger Map Reconsidered</a></em> (2010) and<a href="https://amzn.to/3D5TuQU" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3D5TuQU"> <em>Roman Portable Sundials: The Empire in your Hand</em></a> (2017).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, over on YouTube, Matt Easton has done a couple of videos at the Wallace Collection with the curator there, Dr. Tobias Capwell, <a href="https://youtu.be/oh48_UGQJZ8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://youtu.be/oh48_UGQJZ8">talking first about a set of plate armor stylized to look similar to the distinctive clothing of the <em>Landsknechte</em></a>, early modern German mercenary infantry and <a href="https://youtu.be/DYIVa_hIKFA" data-type="URL" data-id="https://youtu.be/DYIVa_hIKFA">also a longer discussion, focused mostly on Capwell&#8217;s books</a>.  Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/7x6ntkIZuDw" data-type="URL" data-id="https://youtu.be/7x6ntkIZuDw">Skallagrim also has a video rather vividly demonstrating why <em>rigid </em>head protection</a> was generally the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/03/collections-armor-in-order-part-i/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/03/collections-armor-in-order-part-i/">first sort of armor combatants on pre-modern battlefields tried to acquire</a>.  </p>



<p>Finally, on the topic of education and particularly teaching reading (an important thing for any humanist whose discipline is based on the written word), I wanted to highlight this recent article <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/the-rise-and-fall-of-vibes-based-literacy" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/the-rise-and-fall-of-vibes-based-literacy">in <em>The New Yorker</em></a>, based heavily on the work and reporting of Emily Hanford <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2019/08/22/whats-wrong-how-schools-teach-reading" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2019/08/22/whats-wrong-how-schools-teach-reading">who writes over at APMReports</a> and who also <a href="https://features.apmreports.org/sold-a-story/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://features.apmreports.org/sold-a-story/">has a great podcast on the topic</a>.  That&#8217;s basically three ways to get to the same conclusion, which is that we <em>know</em> how to teach English literacy effectively; <strong>we have a small mountain of studies that confirms what works for the greatest number of students and that&#8217;s a phonics-centered approach</strong>.<span id='easy-footnote-7-16136' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/28/fireside-friday-october-28-2022-the-book-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-16136' title='And &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a light sprinkling of phonics on an otherwise broken &amp;#8216;whole language&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;balanced literacy&amp;#8217; approach.'><sup>7</sup></a></span>  But reading education keeps getting distracted by the latest &#8216;shiny object&#8217; to the detriment of students.  I find myself often wondering how declining reading achievement in primary school might also be playing a role in the decline of the humanities, as students who struggle with reading due to substandard teaching methods tend to become less enthusiastic readers later in life.</p>

<p>Finally, for this week&#8217;s <strong>book review</strong>, I am going to recommend M.H. Spring, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3fbnmDo" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3fbnmDo">With Zeal and With Bayonets Only: The British Army on Campaign in North America, 1775-1783</a></em> (2008).  The book is, as its title suggests, an analysis of the Revolutionary War from the British perspective, considering what the British aimed to accomplish militarily, the methods that the British army adopted to achieve those ends (from strategy all the way down to tactical adaptation), and finally the success or lack thereof of those methods.  The first great virtue of this approach is its treatment of the British army as one engaged in the suppression of what was effectively an insurgency, a perspective shift that will, I suspect, be eye-opening for American readers but is quite valuable for the analysis, especially on the strategic level.</p>



<p>The larger intervention here has to do with tactics: Spring takes aim at the Hollywood vision of ungainly Redcoats marching in deep formations being outwitted and outmaneuvered by the clever Americans.  First, Spring explains the <em>whys</em> of linear tactics, which is always a valuable enterprise as to modern eyes such tactics seem almost suicidal and yet <em>they worked extremely well</em> with the technology of the day.  This cannot be said enough: with linear tactics European armies conquered much of the world; they were not stupid even if they seem strange to us.  Nevertheless, Spring does note  that the tight, three-man deep heavy infantry musket line of continental warfare was ill-suited to much of the terrain and fighting in North America, which is why British commanders swiftly dropped it and adapted.  Instead, Spring argues, both British and American forces steadily congealed around fighting in two-deep lines with eighteen inch intervals between files, a departure from the shoulder-to-shoulder European formation which owed to both the lack of effective cavalry in the theater and also the rougher terrain.    Interesting, Spring&#8217;s sources understand the formation as a <em>British</em> adaptation, subsequently adopted widely by both sides.  Moreover, British commanders placed increasingly heavy emphasis on light infantry operating in loose order as the screening and assault force for their armies (though it is difficult not to note how incomplete the implementation of this realization was in the <em>organization</em> of the army).  The impact of the American marksmen is hardly gone however; Spring notes that in loose fighting, the British response was to try to use light infantry with bayonets to quickly shock American forces into retreat.  In relatively open terrain that method <em>worked</em>, but in rougher ground the fighting quickly turned to a shooting match, where the American advantage in numbers told.</p>



<p>Instead, Spring understands British failure (and thus American success) as a consequence of a <em>deeply</em> unfavorable operational environment.  British forces, Spring notes, were always outnumbered and lacked the numerical strength to actually <em>hold</em> any substantial part of the countryside.  They responding by adopting a strategy of trying to batter the Continental Army with heavy losses, which was hopelessly complicated by the general refusal of American generals (especially Washington after early setbacks) to offer the conditions where that could happen, while the logistical difficulties of operating in hostile country with low population density meant that British forces could do little to <em>force</em> those conditions.  The Continental Army could always just withdraw towards the interior where the British regulars could not safely follow, recover and try again.  Meanwhile, repeated clashes steadily honed the Continental Army until the quality gap between it and the British regulars dissipated.  That in turn was a catastrophe for the British as the logistics, finances and political will for only a relatively small force in North America existed; trading progressively more even blows with the Continental Army was not sustainable and so it wasn&#8217;t sustained.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s the fireside.  For the Patrons, look for a few snippets of the book project to show up over the course of November.  For everyone else, have a great November and I&#8217;ll see you all in December!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week&#8217;s post is coming to you all a bit early, as the folks at Paradox Interactive were kind enough to send me a review code for <em>Victoria III</em> &#8211; Paradox Interactive&#8217;s long awaited historical grand strategy game set during 19th and early 20th centuries &#8211; so I could have something to say about it at launch, so I thought I would move this post up in the week to coincide with the end of the review embargo.</p>



<p>This post is going to proceed then in two parts.  First, there&#8217;s going to a be a brief section of my own first impressions; this isn&#8217;t a review per se, but I suppose as close as I can get to one.  Then a long section discussing how the game modifies or builds on the historical perspective taken by its predecessor, <em>Victoria II</em> (which I am henceforth going to call <em>VickyII</em> so that it&#8217;s easy to see which game I mean without counting the numerals, so <em>Victoria III</em> but <em>VickyII</em>), <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/">which we&#8217;ve already discussed</a>.</p>



<p>And of course for the sake of disclosure it seems worth noting that I received an early review code from Paradox and also owned the game already via the PDXCON2022 conference goodies (where I was a paid speaker), so I do have something of an existing relationship with Paradox, though those of you who have read the <a href="https://acoup.blog/category/collections/teaching-paradox/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/category/collections/teaching-paradox/">Teaching Paradox</a> series will know this does not stop me from criticizing their games, sometimes quite stridently.  Finally, these are my impressions having put about 80 hours into the game; I&#8217;ve played a mix of Colombia (into Gran Colombia), Austria (into Austria-Hungary) and Spain (into more Spain), in each case focused more on political and industrial than military aims, though none of these were by any means &#8216;pacifist&#8217; runs, so I&#8217;ve engaged with most of the game&#8217;s systems.</p>



<p>Finally, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/">it is worth remembering that I am singularly responsible for bullying Paradox into announcing <em>Victoria III</em></a>, so I both accept your accolades but also this game as the war reparations I demanded.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impressions</h2>



<p>Overall, <strong>I think <em>Victoria III</em> is a remarkable success at what it sets out to do</strong>, albeit one that, like most of Paradox&#8217;s games, probably won&#8217;t have universal appeal.  I&#8217;m going to talk about this game as a historical project in the next section, but as a <em>game</em> it presents a really capable mix of the traditional strategy of most Paradox games (the diplomacy, scheming, resource allocation, etc.) married to the sort of joy that comes from a lot of production games like <em>Factorio</em> or <em>Satisfactory</em>, that delightful feeling of creating a machine (in this case, a national industrial economy) and then watching it work.  Both of those genres (production games and grand strategy games) have reputations for being really hard on beginners with a high barrier for entry; Paradox has put in a <em>lot</em> of work to make this game beginner friendly and they do as well as anyone could but if you are new to these sorts of games, you should go in expecting to tank your economy or tip your country into revolution at least once.</p>



<p>Fundamentally <em>Victoria III</em> is built around three interlocking pillars: geopolitics (war and peace), economics (industrialization) and politics.  <strong>Paradox has in the past struggled to make their games as interesting in peacetime as in wartime; <em>Victoria III </em>at last I think succeeds completely at this</strong>.  The player is at any time likely to be pursuing parallel interlocking goals in all three pillars, with diplomatic activity often focused on securing resources to support economic activity which reshapes society in ways that make desired political changes possible and so on.  Those interlocking goals generally means the player is <em>always</em> doing something.  While the game runs just from the 1830s to the 1930s, I found myself playing it much more slowly and carefully than other Paradox games (except perhaps for <em>Hearts of Iron</em>), so don&#8217;t let the short time frame fool you: this is a full length Paradox game experience.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15956' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/24/miscellanea-victoria-iii-confirmed-first-impressions/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15956' title='If anything it&amp;#8217;s a bit longer, because the changes that technology and politics create for the game means that &lt;em&gt;Victoria III &lt;/em&gt;makes more complete use of its late game than other Paradox games &amp;#8211; the 1910s are &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from the 1860s, unlike how in, say, &lt;em&gt;CKIII&lt;/em&gt;, 1200 is not very different from 1000.'><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p><strong>A lot of the game in turn is defined by the tension on the one hand between the tremendous, beginner-unfriendly <em>complexity</em> of what the game is trying to simulate and the strenuous, omni-present efforts by the designers to both make that simulation <em>work</em> (it does work, to a degree that <em>VickyII</em> never did) but also to be understandable to the player</strong>.  The game comes not only with an extensive tutorial (which I must admit I mostly skipped), but also for the first time three sets of objectives (essentially military dominance, economic growth or political liberalization) the player can choose to pursue at game start, each with its own set of suggested countries with which to attempt it, though you can play with any goal as any country or any country with no goal at all.  The goals have no direct gameplay impact, but instead give the player a series of intermediate objectives that broadly lead towards a certain outcome.  That&#8217;s really valuable because a lot of the strategy in <em>Victoria III </em>is about staging, mastering the order in which political and economic moves need to come.</p>



<p>Likewise to this end (and presumably making the economic model <em>work</em>) the economic system has been streamlined a bit.  Raw resource production is now built and functions like factories, with the background production of the pre-industrial economy represented by &#8216;peasant&#8217; pops that work in subsistence agriculture and do household production.  All factories are built by the player (avoiding the &#8216;capitalists are dumb&#8217; problem of <em>VickyII</em>) but capitalist pops flush with cash will &#8216;pitch in&#8217; for part of the construction cost of non-government buildings via the Investment Pool, making more free-market regimes attractive for being able to shift much of the construction costs off of the government&#8217;s balance sheet (but beware the political power of the industrialists!).  Meanwhile, the old World Market of <em>VickyII</em> is gone, replaced by a system of national markets that directly trade between each other, with the &#8216;customs union&#8217; treaty allowing one country to join the national market of another (much the way &#8216;sphereing&#8217; worked in <em>VickyII</em>).  Production buildings build up a cash reserve when they make a profit, which depletes when they run negative, meaning that a factory that runs into the red doesn&#8217;t <em>immediately</em> begin laying off workers, leading to a lot less economic shuddering than in the previous game.</p>



<p><strong>The result of all of these little changes is to make the economic game a lot more manageable and intelligible to the player</strong>.  It is fairly easy to grasp the cycles of expanding raw material production to push down the prices of those raw resources to support larger factories producing finished goods at a profit, all of it employing larger and larger numbers of pops at a higher standard of living than the subsistence economy (which in turn has positive political ramifications).  At the same time, this has to be balanced: push down prices too much and factories will lose money and lay off employees until prices stabilize; drive prices too far up (by exporting goods) and your factories will be extremely profitable moments before they are burned down by your revolutionary citizens responding to the declining Standard of Living (SoL) as a consequence of high prices.  This isn&#8217;t quite a <em>no </em>compromises change; the lack of a world market makes the industrial &#8216;start up&#8217; sequence a bit tricky, especially for small economies, where having no factories producing a good means you have none, but one factory is <em>way</em> too much for your small economy; exporting the excess can be difficult making it really valuable (but also tricky) to be in the customs union of a greater power.  At the same time, this isn&#8217;t &#8216;dumbed down&#8217; either &#8211; as your economy grows, the juggling act of continuing expansion to maintain upward standard of living changes becomes increasingly tricky as you&#8217;re now building <em>dozens</em> of factories, mines, farms and railroads simultaneously.</p>



<p>The biggest change to the Paradox formula though comes with war and diplomacy.  Rather than declaring wars, countries now embark on &#8216;diplomatic plays,&#8217; essentially making a demand that triggers an international crisis.  Other countries can either intervene or declare neutrality as the crisis counts down to war; either side can back down, ceding the other side&#8217;s primary demand (but not the secondary ones) if it looks like a war would be unwinnable.  It&#8217;s a good system for simulating the diplomatic push-and-pull of a globalizing world where Great Powers might meddle in the political disputes of far away regions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the war system is quite different.  Gone are moving individual armies through provinces, replaced by &#8216;fronts&#8217; to which armies are assigned to either defend or push forward. <strong> I think some players are going to be quite unhappy with the level of abstraction here, but I really like this system.  It puts the player in the actual shoes of political leadership: set the goals, assign the resources, hire the general, <em>hope for the best</em></strong>.  If it limits the player&#8217;s ability to solve every problem by pulling off a flawless sequence of Alexander-the-Great-esque unlikely victories (usually by abusing the AI), so much the better.  I will admit the system is a bit better formed to reflect war in the early 1900s than the mid-1800s, though with sufficient military mismatch in combat capabilities, lightning campaigns like those of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War">Franco-Prussian War</a> are very possible.  The system also very strongly favors army <em>quality</em> over army <em>quantity</em>, but that seems era appropriate.  I suspect this system is probably one of the most likely to get a post-launch overhaul, but as a foundation I think it&#8217;s actually quite good.</p>

This is a political configuration &#8211; industrialists, unions and the intelligentsia dominate, while the landholders are marginalized &#8211; that take quite a bit of work to achieve, but is roughly the configuration you want if the goal is a liberal democracy or social democracy.  For most of the game though I should note you will not have this many &#8216;happy&#8217; interest groups &#8211; that was a product of my sky-high standard of living creating lots of loyalists (an effect which fades over time as folks get used to the new high living standards).</figcaption></figure>



<p>The last major pillar is internal politics, which is mostly about reshaping a country to fit the player&#8217;s aims without breaking it in one devastating revolution after another.  The country&#8217;s political system is broken up into a series of interest groups defined broadly by attitude and social class (aristocrats/landowners, industrialists, intellectuals, trade unions, etc.) whose power (&#8216;clout&#8217;) is determined both by the raw numbers and wealth but also by the structure of the country itself.  The player&#8217;s path to reform then is a careful one &#8211; some reforms may be desirable because of their economic or social impacts, while others are useful because of how they change the political balance of power.  In most cases, countries begin dominated by a landholder elite broadly averse to change, backed by military and religious interests; that coalition has to be carefully dismantled <em>first</em> before the player can make major moves to embrace liberalism, socialism or both.  And the combination of laws and institutions do provide a real range of end-states, pairing governing systems with economic and social systems.  <strong>This whole system is much more interactive and intuitive than it was in <em>VickyII</em> and much more engaging; it&#8217;s a remarkable design success</strong>.</p>



<p>I will say some quirk I did notice is that certain major historical events in this period seemed rather less likely to happen on their own than I&#8217;d expect.  AI Prussia seems to generally be pretty weak and as such struggles to unify Germany, the American Civil War doesn&#8217;t seem to always occur or doesn&#8217;t occur quite right and I have not yet seen Italy unify (although to be fair, in my longest game I was Austria and thus actively working to prevent both Italian and German unification).  Unification events can fire &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen a Scandinavian Union in one of my games &#8211; but less often, it seems than in <em>VickyII</em>.  I don&#8217;t think the <em>player</em> will find it impossible to produce these outcomes, but the AI right now seems to find it difficult.  On the other hand a certain vocal segment of the player-base ought to rejoice: <em>Victoria III</em> has railroads, but it has very little railroading.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also say that I found myself outstripping the AI by the end of midgame (which of course compounds as that massive GDP is reinvested back into industrialization).  Of course this is a Paradox game; if you want a harder challenge, you can play a harder country and there is almost always a country that is some version of &#8216;that country, but harder.&#8217;  At the same time, I&#8217;ve played every Paradox game since <em>Hearts of Iron II</em> (though <em>EU3</em> was my first, I went back for <em>HoI2</em>) and so I tend to be pretty capable at them.<span id='easy-footnote-2-15956' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/24/miscellanea-victoria-iii-confirmed-first-impressions/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15956' title='To benchmark that, I suppose, I haven&amp;#8217;t played &lt;em&gt;HoI4&lt;/em&gt; on anything less than elite difficulty in quite a long time and I play &lt;em&gt;Stellaris&lt;/em&gt; on scaling difficulty to Grand Admiral.  So I&amp;#8217;m not the Viking God of Paradox Games, but I think I can claim to have gotten fairly good at them.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>  Still, I suspect as the player-base grows with experience with the systems there will be calls for difficulty modifiers and for Paradox to sharpen the AI a bit.  Here, frankly, I think the key is a game that <em>works</em>; AI fine-tuning can come later and that pattern is one that will already be quite familiar to longtime Paradox fans (e.g. the <em>HoI4</em> AI is substantially more capable now than when the game launched).</p>



<p>Finally, I think something should be said about presentation.  <strong>As I hope you can tell from the screenshots, taken on my admittedly now quite old computer, this game is <em>very</em> pretty, for a strategy game</strong>.  Moreover, the towns and cities on the map grow and expand dynamically in response to what the player is doing; factories, mines and farms appear visually in their respective provinces, while cities expand out with dense urban terrain as the urban population expands.  There&#8217;s a real joy to watching a country go from a largely undeveloped, rural countryside dotted with small towns to a dense mix of cities and factories, crisscrossed with railroad and roads (that go from having wagons to cars and trucks).  Meanwhile the soundtrack may be one of Paradox&#8217;s best (I also had the pre-order bonus with the <em>VickyII</em> soundtrack remastered in the track list, which was lovely).</p>

<p><strong>Overall then my takeaway is largely &#8216;they did it.&#8217;</strong>  Naturally there is some Paradox jank; the AI doesn&#8217;t always make the right war demands, leading to sometimes strange borders (though not generally <em>to</em> bad) and the system of fronts in war can create oddities where borders between warring alliance blocs are complex.  Some opaqueness in the economic simulation remains as well, though mostly these are things where a brief hunt through the menus will reveal the problems.<span id='easy-footnote-3-15956' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/24/miscellanea-victoria-iii-confirmed-first-impressions/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15956' title='A hint: if you suddenly go from modestly budget-positive to massively budget-negative for no apparent reason, check to see if you&amp;#8217;ve depleted the investment pool.  Over-heating your building sector &amp;#8211; for which you are the primary customer &amp;#8211; is a major trap, since it can lock you in a position where if you keep building you will run out of money, but if you stop building, all of the industries you built that sell to the building sector (iron, timber, steel, glass, etc) will crash.  That&amp;#8217;s not a design failure, but rather a very real trap in economic development.  Always be thinking about balance between industries where you, the government, are the main customer (arms, munitions, construction, ships and also paper) and industries where your people or foreign countries are the main customer (food, clothes, furniture, services and also any export goods).  You need much more of the latter to support the former.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>  <strong>But broadly it <em>works</em>, the basic game loops are really satisfying and the different countries provide some really interesting and different starts, with different problems and goals</strong>.  A game this complex isn&#8217;t going to be for everyone, but if you aren&#8217;t afraid of complexity and always wanted a game somewhere between <em>EUIV</em> and <em>Factorio</em>&#8230;this is it.  And it is good.</p>



<p>Before I close this out an obligatory performance note.  I ran this game on my (frankly, aging) computer.  My setup runs an Intel i7-6700 (3.4GHz came out in 2015) with a GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card (came out in 2016) with 16GB of system RAM, which is hardly a cutting edge system these days but also while older <em>is</em> a purpose-built (by me) gaming rig.  The game ran quite well on my machine, with some late-game slowdown when there were major wars on, which seemed to be much more a processor issue than graphics (no shock there); they weren&#8217;t too bad and didn&#8217;t stop me playing, but presumably would be worse with a lower-end machine.  So while on the one hand you don&#8217;t need a super-computer to run this game, on the other hand very low end machines (or old machines) may struggle with the late-game CPU load, especially with very large countries.<span id='easy-footnote-4-15956' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/24/miscellanea-victoria-iii-confirmed-first-impressions/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15956' title='And to be clear, the map is beautiful, but the performance bottleneck will probably be CPU load, which is no shock when you consider the &lt;em&gt;staggering&lt;/em&gt; ambition of a game attempting a 1-to-1 economic simulation of the 1800s.'><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>On to the analysis!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mechanics and Gears</h2>



<p>I think the best way to structure this is to move through some of my Paradox analysis in order and discuss how <em>Victoria III</em> either changes or builds on the points I made about <em>Victoria II</em>.</p>



<p>  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/">And a good place to begin is the generational scheme I set up for Paradox&#8217;s offerings;</a> <strong>I suggested a typology of three &#8216;generations&#8217; of Paradox games based on some of their common design sensibilities.</strong>  All of the pre-Clausewitz Engine games were &#8216;first generation&#8217; (mostly because I haven&#8217;t really played them, except for <em>HoI2</em>).  The second generation (<em>EU3, HoI3, VickyII</em>) were typified by their use of hard-coded events to ensure historical outcomes, while the third generation (<em>CKII, EU4, HoI4, Stellaris</em> and <em>Imperator</em>) were defined by their substantially more flexible structure, with fewer events and decisions locked to specific country-tags.  I then noted that I couldn&#8217;t really say if <em>CKIII</em> represented an evolution of the Gen3 design or if we should understand it as properly marking the start of what we might call Gen4.  Playing <em>Victoria III</em> makes me lean towards the latter.  I think together with <em>CKIII</em>, <em>Victoria III </em>reflects a design sensibility aiming to reaffirm some of the elements of historical &#8216;simulation,&#8217; backing away from some of the more obviously artificial &#8216;currencies&#8217; (so-called &#8216;mana&#8217;) in favor of resources which are more explicitly tied to historical concepts.  There&#8217;s also a clear <em>visual</em> shift towards making the game itself (and especially the map) itself more engaging and more visually reflective of the player&#8217;s actions, something that has always been present in these games but evidently can now be more fully realized.</p>



<p>That generation &#8216;skip&#8217; makes for a pretty radical change in design sensibilities from <em>VickyII</em> to <em>Victoria</em> <em>III</em>.  The example I used for instance about how <em>VickyII</em> hard-codes immigration to go to the Americas?  That&#8217;s entirely gone in <em>Victoria III</em>, with immigration instead depending on laws (migration controls but also pops don&#8217;t want to migrate to places they&#8217;ll be discriminated against as far as I can tell) and economics (the standard of living).  The United States is still in a really solid position to capitalize on mass immigration, but the player can pull this off <em>anywhere</em> by pushing standard of living up and implementing a liberal and tolerant legal structure; I&#8217;ve achieved massive immigration bonazas as <em>Austria</em> and <em>Spain</em> &#8211; people move to where there are jobs and favorable laws.  That &#8216;systems over hard-coded events&#8217; shift is broadly indicative of the two-generation jump here.  I said in the original post,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/"> &#8220;my suspicion is that <em>Victoria III </em>will tend to push harder against a deterministic viewpoint.&#8221;</a>  <em><strong>Check</strong></em>.</p>

<p><strong>More broadly I noted that <em>VickyII </em>was a game about pops and that design is carried over almost verbatim</strong>.  Indeed, if anything it is <em>intensified here</em>; the game now simulates women and children as well so it really is now an effort to manage a 1-to-1 simulation of the population (gender and child labor laws determine what percentage, if any, of those women and children can work).  Likewise the shift from a pre-industrial household and subsistence economy to an industrial one is maintained.  One big change here that I really quite like is that the shift from traditional subsistence farming to larger scale industrial farming (&#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure">enclosure</a>&#8216;) is more directly represented.  Each province has an amount of arable land; if left undeveloped, it will fill with unemployed pops eking out a meager living as subsistence farmers (&#8216;peasants&#8217;); developing that land by building big market-oriented farms will increase production, but it also reduces the last available for those peasants, kicking them into unemployment if no other options are available.  Consequently reorganizing the agricultural sector <em>can</em> be a key route towards greater wealth and prosperity for everyone, but it can <em>also</em> lead to the misery of peasants who are left with no land to farm and no jobs to find; left for a length of time they&#8217;ll leave your country for some place with work (which, of course, is <em>bad</em> because you want to keep your pops!).</p>



<p>On the flipside, the change in how you build factories fixes a major problem with <em>VickyII</em>, which was that the economic engine never worked right.  Here the solution is letting the player plan all factory construction (there is, mercifully, an &#8216;auto-expand-this-factory&#8217; button which will keep enlarging a factory every time its cash reserves fill) and making the economic system balance the degree to which the player can intervene to subsidize or government-run factories against the amount of building assistance capitalists will offer via the investment pool.  Combined with the shift away from the world market, this produces an economic simulation that, at last, <em>works</em>.</p>

<p>The basic sequence of industrial development is present in the game.  It is a <em>bit</em> less teleological in that there are somewhat different paths available to countries based on the raw resources they have access to; countries without access to lots of oil, rubber, silk or dye are going to end up with economies that look somewhat different from countries with those things.  But broadly the sequence of industrial innovation is represented pretty well here, as it was in <em>VickyII</em>, with an interwoven set of tech-trees performing the same task as <em>VickyII</em>&#8216;s innovations, demonstrating interlocking technologies interacting with each other.  That said <em>some</em> of those interactions are lost, I assume in an effort to simplify a fairly formidable tech tree: techs are split into three categories (industrial, military, social) and cannot have cross dependencies between categories.  That means it&#8217;s possible to have steamships without steam engines (though good luck building any due to the building dependencies) but really unlikely.</p>



<p><strong>But more importantly I think the game works even harder to focus the player on thinking about the changes they are making in terms of how they would be <em>experienced</em> by people</strong>.  Central to this is &#8216;standard of living,&#8217; a new stat which compresses <em>VickyII</em>&#8216;s &#8216;needs&#8217; into a single number.  In short, pops get money from their jobs, which they use to buy goods to survive (food, fuel, clothes, etc.); the more of these goods they can get with their money, the higher their standard of living is.  For poorer pops (who, being much more numerous, have a stronger overall impact), the key goods are basic staples: wheat, simple clothes, wood (for home heating) and so on; these make up the largest components of household spending.  So standard of living can go up because prices of goods fall (because you are producing or importing more of them) or because wages went up (which happens as profitable employers compete for scarce workers); the reverse lowers standard of living.</p>



<p>Standard of living in turn has a very strong impact on &#8216;radicalism,&#8217; which now replaces militancy.  High radicalism both makes politics harder and revolution more likely (and makes it harder to hit key support thresholds to get bonuses from your political factions), but it also can create &#8216;turmoil&#8217; in specific states, which lowers tax income and negative impacts migration.  Radicalism is thus very fundamentally <em>bad</em> for the player and it is caused both by falling standard of living <em>or</em> by stable standard of living below pop expectations.  One very common midgame interaction you will see for incompletely industrialized countries is that as new factory workers bid up the price of basic staples with their higher salaries, radicalism among the remaining peasantry &#8211; rapidly being priced out of <em>living</em> due to their very limited economic resources &#8211; can become very radical, which can lead to a lot of instability.  Which is, of course, a really common thing in industrializing economies!</p>



<p>On the flipside, <em>rising</em> standard of living is <em>very good</em> for the player.  It creates &#8216;loyalists&#8217; &#8211; folks <em>happy</em> with the regime &#8211; who do the opposite things as radicals and are quite potent as a stabilizing factor in your political makeup.  Moreover, the average standard of living in a state sets the baseline migration attraction factor (which is then modified by temporary effects).  That&#8217;s <em>hugely</em> beneficial to the player because you are going to need a <em>lot</em> of pops to fill your mines, factories and new, industrial farms and unless you are playing a country like China, your basic population growth will still leave you pop-hungry (especially if you are playing the colonialism game to get resources your home country lacks to feed those factories).  And you&#8217;d think that all that immigration would bid down the SoL in your country, but because your factories can become quite labor efficient, assuming capital investment can keep up (and the flow of raw materials can be maintained) it can have the opposite effect: massive factories employing hundreds of thousands of workers with <em>enormous</em> through-put bonuses can stay profitable while crashing goods prices through the floor even at high wages.  And you, the state, on the top of all of this, also reap the advantages in terms of military and economic power (read: soldiers and taxes).  <strong>Consequently, the player is <em>really</em> encouraged to care about the standard of living effects of their actions, <em>even more</em> than in <em>VickyII</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Overall then, <em>Victoria III</em> doubles down in <em>VickyII</em>&#8216;s focus on pops as the center of the story, while at the same time trying to make that story a bit more intelligible to the player.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Ruin of War</h2>



<p>Moving to <strong>diplomacy and war</strong>,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/20/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-ii-the-ruin-of-war/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/20/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-ii-the-ruin-of-war/"> <em>VickyII</em> had this wonderful hidden interaction where gains to warfare were slowly eclipsed by its destructiveness</a>.  My own sense of <em>VickyII </em>was that this interaction was an unintentional, emergent property of the game&#8217;s systems and thus the game didn&#8217;t highlight or harness it fully but that nevertheless this was the crowning achievement of the design.  Well, I don&#8217;t know if the <em>Victoria III</em> team just reads this blog (actually, I do know they read this blog, but I don&#8217;t know if they decided on the following design elements before I wrote about them) or if they just made the same realization I did, but <strong><em>Victoria III</em> takes that &#8216;hidden&#8217; interaction and draws it out much more clearly</strong>.</p>



<p>Armies in <em>Victoria III</em> consist of regiments, each of which is created by a building &#8211; either a barracks for permanent, professional forces or conscription centers for mobilized conscripts.  New technologies unlock new ways of fighting which can be chosen from the buildings; the main statistics are &#8216;offense&#8217; (the army&#8217;s power when attacking) and &#8216;defense&#8217; (the same when defending).  Early in the game, technologies tend to improve these two statistics more or less evenly, with defense having perhaps a slight edge; relatively small gaps in technology can produce a military &#8216;overmatch&#8217; that can result in being able to rapidly overrun an enemy country on the offensive, whereas wars against peers tend to be more grinding things.</p>



<p>That situation begins to shift fairly quickly for the cutting edge countries in three key ways.  First, technological advancements begin around the middle of the tech tree to favor defense, making it easier to defend territory than to take it; that tendency becomes stronger and stronger until some very late game technologies reverse it.  At the same time, several technologies increase &#8216;kill rate&#8217; (the rate at which a unit inflicts casualties as compared to the morale damage it inflicts), making battles bloodier (once again, asymmetry in these technologies can produce brutally one-sided fights).  Finally, upgrading to these new ways of fighting demands <em>more</em> materiel, especially the &#8216;munitions&#8217; good (in addition to &#8216;small arms&#8217; and &#8216;artillery&#8217;), which can get expensive <em>fast</em>.  <strong>Consequently, both the human and financial cost of military activity increases as a factor of time</strong>, <strong>while rising defense is designed to produce brutal, high-casualty deadlocks if both participants have them</strong>.</p>



<p>Which is much the interaction in <em>VickyII</em>, albeit with some of the jank (like the inevitable crushing global mid-century liquor shortage and no, I am not kidding, ask any <em>VickyII</em> player and they will tell you about this) removed.  But now the <em>presentation</em> is crucially different: <strong><em>Victoria III</em></strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>shows total casualties and financial cost for both sides on the war screen</strong>.  And these can be <em>staggering</em>.  As I write this, I just observed AI Russia involved in a war to try to seize Moldavia in 1890-1; the war pulled in Austria, Egypt and the Ottomans.  The end result was a white peace, but not before Russia lost 1.7 <em>million</em> men killed or wounded, spending more than £40 <em>million</em> in the fighting; I didn&#8217;t get a total for the other side (a number of them had &#8216;peaced out&#8217; and so their costs weren&#8217;t listed on the screen), but when I viewed the war mid-progress, they weren&#8217;t doing any better.</p>

The cost of the war thus substantially already exceeded the population of the territory to be gained and this is only in 1891.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, the new &#8216;front&#8217; system is almost certainly going to get some polishing, but is actually a good match for simulating the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/09/17/collections-no-mans-land-part-i-the-trench-stalemate/" data-type="post" data-id="8552">WWI deadlock</a>.  And it avoids one of the problems in this bit of history that I found when I discussed this interaction in <em>VickyII</em>.  When I noted that the best way to win WWI in <em>VickyII</em> was to <em>not</em> fight WWI, several readers noted that actually they actually found they could trounce their way through the First World War just fine, both by being comically ahead of time on tech but also by abusing the AI by drawing it into foolish fights (forts being a big contender here).  And here I think the &#8216;front&#8217; system &#8211; and this take is going to upset some people &#8211; is an <em>improvement</em> because it guides the player <em>away</em> from making micro-managing army decisions which political leaders <em>wouldn&#8217;t make</em> in any event.</p>



<p>It also allows the game to be a bit more deliberate about how war impacts people and economics.  Occupied territory accrues &#8216;devastation&#8217; from the fighting on it, which wears off slowly once the war is done but until it does provides economic penalties.  A long, grinding late-game war can thus ruin territories <em>that aren&#8217;t lost</em>.  At the same time, the economic disruption creates radicals (especially in occupied territories) which as noted above &#8211; having radicals <em>is a very bad thing</em> the player is going to want to avoid.  Devastation and the turmoil caused by the massive local increase in radicalism are both clearly marked on the map, so once again an interaction that was easy to miss in <em>VickyII</em> is now explicit so the player can see, &#8220;oh man, that long war I won but where my key province was occupied for a few months is going to have long-lasting negative implications to my political stability.&#8221;</p>



<p>That said, it is still possible at present to get sufficiently technologically and economically ahead of the AI by the late-game (especially if you start as a major European power) to obviate this whole thing.  I think I understand the instinct here: the developers want countries that <em>aren&#8217;t</em> Prussia, France or Britain to be able to &#8216;catch up&#8217; by the late game, but I think some systems to hold back a player blazing too far ahead might be a good idea.  I hesitate to suggest it, but they made need an &#8216;ahead of time&#8217; penalty on technology research, for instance.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the big advance here is taking the interaction that already existed and <em>informing the player about it</em>.  While I fear for what this sort of design philosophy will do for my job security as a History Game Explainer, for the player it makes the &#8216;theory of history&#8217; much easier to discover, which is good.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">World&#8217;s Fair</h2>



<p>Finally we come to the world beyond the great powers, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/09/03/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-iii-worlds-fair/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/09/03/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-iii-worlds-fair/">which was where I had my heaviest criticism for <em>VickyII</em>&#8216;s design</a>.  And while in this case I know many of these design decisions were made well before I wrote my essay, if I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> know that I&#8217;d be tempted to assume it was used as a checklist of things to fix.</p>



<p>I opened by critiquing <em>VickyII&#8217;s</em> division of people into &#8216;civilized nations&#8217; &#8216;uncivilized nations&#8217; and &#8216;uncolonized lands.&#8217;  The first two have now been replaced by recognized and unrecognized powers; the former are members of the European state system, the latter are not.  Importantly, these conditions are now completely independent of economic development and government form (they were all tied up together in &#8216;westernization&#8217; in <em>VickyII</em>); recognition is <em>purely</em> a diplomatic question and a power can <em>become</em> recognized by forcing an already recognized power to do so via a diplomatic play (so Japan could achieve recognition as part of the Russo-Japanese War, for instance).  That&#8217;s much better as a way of expressing the slanted international system European imperialism created.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, &#8216;uncolonized lands&#8217; are now &#8216;decentralized powers&#8217; and I just love the this change so much, even though decentralized powers are not playable (you play as a central state, a thing which these folks are defined by not having).  Decentralized powers still have pops and clearly defined territories (shown in outline whereas the other powers&#8217; color shades their whole country) but as the game notes lack a single centralized government strong enough to force other powers to interact with it.  Consequently, the other powers can encroach on their territory &#8211; the colonization mechanic &#8211; without triggering a diplomatic incident with the other centralized powers.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean these decentralized powers are passive; pushing into their territory creates tension with all of the decentralized powers in the area, who may then rise up and attempt to throw the invader out.  Those efforts at fighting back mostly fail, as they mostly failed historically, but it gives these decentralized powers a real sense of agency they totally lacked in <em>VickyII</em>.  Moreover it now makes very clear that these parts of the world (primarily the Great Plains in North America and large sections of Africa) were not <em>empty</em>.  Instead states expanding into those regions are very clearly <em>taking that land from someone</em>.  <strong>I want to see this system used in place of the old colonization mechanics in every future Paradox game</strong> (which mostly means <em>EU5</em> if and when it is greenlit).</p>



<p>And the technological sequence which both makes the scramble for Africa possible and then motivates it to happen is now much clearer.  Instead of the nebulous &#8216;life rating&#8217; system, <em>Victoria III</em> presents a fairly explicit &#8216;malaria wall&#8217; as it were, with some states having &#8216;malaria&#8217; or &#8216;severe malaria&#8217; as modifiers; if your country isn&#8217;t already <em>from</em> such a region, either the quinine or more advanced malaria prevention techs are necessary to effectively push into these regions.  Meanwhile, railroads and steamships are crucial for producing the infrastructure necessary for a colonizing power to actually get any resources <em>out</em> of these regions; the fit with D.R. Headrick&#8217;s argument in <em>Tools of Empire</em> (1981) &#8211; guns, quinine, steam engines &#8211; is much closer.</p>



<p>Meanwhile European imperialism in Africa is far more clearly tethered to the desire of European states to get key resources.  For the player in <em>Victoria III</em> playing as a non-equatorial country, coffee (from cocoa), tea and rubber are all goods that simply won&#8217;t be available domestically.  While the former two are consumer goods, the latter is a key industrial product that is likely to send the player scrambling for supply in the mid-to-late game.  One resource that is missing here that was very important for expansion especially in West Africa is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_oil" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_oil">palm oil</a></em>, which was a key industrial lubricant prior to the development of more ubiquitous petroleum based products (whale oil as an alternative to petroleum <em>does</em> exist in game, so it seems like adding palm oil here would be a fairly easy change, albeit with some balance implications, but then again the ramp towards an oil-based economy frankly needs smoothing anyway from a balance perspective).</p>



<p><strong>There is one new problem with how <em>Victoria III</em> handles imperialism though and that is the existence of several &#8216;dominions&#8217; and the way they behave, particularly the East India companies of the British and the Dutch</strong>.  Both function as satellites that the player playing as the suzerain has relatively little control over.  I assume this was in part for balance and in part to reduce the complexity of running the whole British Empire but frankly it suggests a greater degree of distance in terms of how these places were ruled, since historically speaking imperial control over these areas was often quite direct.  &#8216;Company rule&#8217; in the Dutch East Indies, for instance, ended in 1800, well before the game starts.  The continuation of the British East India Company makes more sense (it was dissolved in 1874), but in practice the line between these two systems could be thin.  It also creates gameplay balance issues, wherein the overlord cannot, for instance, direct their colonial dominions to develop specific resources (a problem that does not exist for later colonies in Africa) which is wild given that for most of this period the Dutch policy in their colonies in Indonesia was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivation_System" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivation_System">enforced planting</a> of specific cash crops and until 1901 official Dutch policy was that the whole region was a <em>wingewest</em>, &#8216;profit region.&#8217;  I think to better match this history the Dutch colonies in Indonesia should start already as part of the Netherlands as &#8216;unincorporated states&#8217; (see below), while colonial overlords should be able to set building priorities in their subjects (which may be as simple as letting the overlord build buildings in subject territory).</p>



<p>On the other hand one thing I had wished for was for the design to revisit the &#8216;state-ification&#8217; process and indeed, it has.  In particular, I thought that players ought to be at least <em>offered</em> the counter-factual of attempting to integrate existing colonial territories fully, encouraging indigenous development, declaring local cultures tolerated and valued and extending political participation and rights to the people who lived there.  That is, to be clear, a fairly clear counter-factual in all but a handful of typically very small cases, but it seemed like it ought to be something the player <em>could</em> do and in <em>Victoria III</em> it is, through a mix of incorporating states and passing laws removing discrimination on the basis of ethnicity and religion.  There are challenges to it, since extending public services over more people costs money and bureaucracy (which also costs money) and will cause wages in those regions to rise which can reduce profits, and moreover reactionary elements will fight <em>bitterly</em> to stop those law changes (and consequently doing all of this is much easier if the country in question is <em>already</em> an immigrant-driven multi-cultural state which given that <em>by far</em> the largest examples of such permanent overseas &#8216;state-ification&#8217; are Hawaii and Alaska makes a good deal of sense).</p>



<p><strong>Finally, I had groused a bit that while <em>VickyII</em> did well for making slavery a major part of the experience of playing the United States and some other countries, it did not really reflect slavery as a <em>global</em> institution, nor the degree to which stamping that institution out was at times achieved by &#8216;gunboat diplomacy.&#8217;  Both are now addressed</strong>.  Non-free workers are now represented by both &#8216;serfs&#8217; and &#8216;slaves.&#8217;  In countries that have the &#8216;serfdom&#8217; law, all of the subsistence farmers (&#8216;peasants&#8217;) are serfs, which reduces their standard of living while the institution is both fiercely defended by and politically empowers the landholder class.  Slavery is divided into three categories: &#8216;debt slavery,&#8217; an active &#8216;slave trade&#8217; and &#8216;legacy slavery&#8217; where the institution is permitted to exist as long as it doesn&#8217;t expand and the large-scale import of new enslaved persons is banned.  A <em>lot</em> of countries have one of these laws at game start, reflecting global institutions of non-free labor of varying kinds (though the <em>percentage</em> of enslaved persons varies widely and a player even casually glancing at the demographic makeup of the Caribbean or the American South will immediately realize something is <em>quite different</em> in these places).</p>



<p>As in <em>VickyII</em>, the player is motivated to want to get rid of slavery for a number of reasons.  For one, free workers are better, economically, than enslaved workers as they&#8217;re able to more flexibly transition between jobs, earn wages (enslaved pops get &#8216;upkeep&#8217; instead of wages and thus are stuck with very low standard of living), obtain a higher standard of living and generate less radicalism.  Also, slavery is bad.  Moreover, chances are the player intends to implement at least <em>some</em> government changes, but both slavery and serfdom <em>massively</em> empower the landholder interest group who are <em>for sure</em> going to oppose basically anything the player tries to do politically.  Consequently in running a country with slavery &#8211; now a much wider range of countries &#8211; the game pretty much invites the player to &#8216;think like an abolitionist&#8217; as it were, looking for ways to lever out the country&#8217;s landholder fueled enslaver&#8217;s caucus in order to open up new economic and political paths.  And that, I think, is a good frame to put the player into.</p>



<p>I will say that as I played it right now the American Civil War <em>can</em> happen but it tends to be an odd creature and I suspect this is something that will get more treatment later.  Historically speaking, by the 1830s, a lot of the &#8216;cake&#8217; was &#8216;baked&#8217; for the American Civil War to eventually happen, but in the game as it is now the United States often gets quite late, chronologically before this bomb goes off when AI controlled.  I haven&#8217;t yet played as the USA, so I haven&#8217;t seen this tension &#8216;from the inside&#8217; but from the outside it still looks a bit wonky.  Still, this is exactly the sort of thing &#8216;flavor packs&#8217; are made for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusions</h2>



<p>All told, I think <em>Victoria III</em> retains the elements that most drew me to <em>VickyII</em> but they are built now on a much stronger foundation.  And of course given the way that Paradox development goes, that is always how one has to view a fresh new release: as a foundation for future work.  And I can certainly see where some of that work can go, but the foundation seems solid to me.  As I write this, Paradox has committed themselves to at least an Expansion, an immersion pack, a radio pack and an art pack post-launch, so it is clear they intend to build on the foundation.</p>



<p>Understandably, a lot of the development work in crafting that foundation has gone into the major European powers.  What I find most promising here, however, is that the groundwork for non-European states and peoples is <em>much better</em> and so I hope that subsequent work really capitalizes on that groundwork, both in terms of playing those non-European states but also in feedback to a player running a European state with global reach.  There are already a few events that speak to the kind of experiences that European imperialism could create, but that&#8217;s a part of this era that I think needs to be expanded upon and I hope will be.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I think the political system, now that it is a lot more transparent and responsive, creates the opportunity to really show interconnections between the politics of various states as ideas crossed borders.  It is, after all, not an accident that historically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848">the Springtime of Nations in 1848</a> seemed to be contagious as both liberal and nationalist ideas spilled over borders with sudden and unpredictable effects.  With the player able to better tell what is going <em>on</em> with their politics, I think it&#8217;d be easier to have events where, for instance, a liberal shift or imperial crack-up might in turn trigger major political shifts in neighboring countries (both positive and negative, since just as you have the liberalizing wave of the 1840s &#8211; and the crackdown that followed &#8211; you also have the totalitarian wave of the 1920s and 30s).  Certainly the post-Conference of Vienna world was one in which the monarchs of Europe (and eventually the rest of the world) recognized that the contagiousness of revolution represented a threat to all of them.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t want these &#8216;areas for further development&#8217; to misrepresent my tone here.  <em>Victoria III</em> is a big step forward from <em>VickyII</em> and has some ideas &#8211; especially decentralized powers &#8211; that I now really want to see in every subsequent Paradox game and hopefully picked up more broadly by the historical strategy genre.</p>



<p>Final Verdict: I am 80 hours in and my &#8216;countries to play&#8217; list isn&#8217;t getting any shorter.<span id='easy-footnote-5-15956' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/24/miscellanea-victoria-iii-confirmed-first-impressions/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-15956' title='At minimum, I want to do runs with the USA, Mexico, the Ottomans, Prussia, Egypt and the Qing.  Maybe also a form-Scandinavia run, since the new immigration mechanics make small-pop countries a lot more viable than they were in &lt;em&gt;VickyII&lt;/em&gt;.'><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>



<p>And as a final note, there will be a short Fireside on Friday before the start of November.  <em>ACOUP</em> will then be on a one-month hiatus for November while I work on some research writing.  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patrons </a>will be getting a few snippets of that work as a treat to make up for the lack of regular content.  So, Fireside on Friday (10/28), then a break and we&#8217;ll be back in December (12/2)!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week, I&#8217;m going to offer a fairly basic overview of the concept of strategic airpower, akin to our discussions of <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/03/03/collections-how-the-weak-can-win-a-primer-on-protracted-war/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2022/03/03/collections-how-the-weak-can-win-a-primer-on-protracted-war/">protracted war</a> and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/03/11/collections-nuclear-deterrence-101/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2022/03/11/collections-nuclear-deterrence-101/">nuclear deterrence</a>.  While the immediate impetus for this post has been Russian efforts to use airpower coercively in Ukraine, we&#8217;re going to focus more broadly on the topic: what <em>is</em> strategic airpower, where did the idea come from, how has it been used and does it actually <em>work</em>?  As with nuclear deterrence, this is a much debated topic, so what I am going to present here is an overview of the sort I&#8217;d provide for an introductory class on the topic and then at the end we&#8217;ll cover some of the implications for the current conflict in Ukraine.  That said, this is also an issue where I think most historians of the topic tend to part ways with both some things the public think they know about the topic and some of the things that occasionally the relevant branches of the military <em>want</em> to know about the topic; in any case I am going to try to present a fairly &#8216;down the middle&#8217; historian&#8217;s view of the question.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15716' title='For a longer and more sustained discussion of the topic still pitched at a general readership, W.E. Lee, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3MR3Rwr&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://amzn.to/3MR3Rwr&quot;&gt;Waging War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2016), chapter 13 is focused on this topic, along with the related topics of nuclear deterrence and the emergence of precision-guided munitions.  That&amp;#8217;s the textbook I use when I teach the intro-level global history of warfare, so as you might imagine what follows here follows it fairly closely.'><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Before we dive in, we need to define what makes certain uses of airpower <em>strategic</em> because strategic airpower isn&#8217;t the only kind.  The reason for the definition will emerge pretty quickly when we talk about origins, but let&#8217;s get it out of the way here: <strong>strategic airpower is the use of attack by air (read: bombing) to achieve &#8216;strategic effects.&#8217;</strong>  Now that formal definition is a bit tautological, but it becomes clarifying when we talk about what we mean by strategic effects; these are effects that aim to alter enemy policy or win the war <em>on their own</em>.</p>



<p>Put another way, if you use aircraft to attack enemy units in support of a ground operation (like an invasion), that would be <em>tactical</em> airpower; the airpower is a <em>tactic</em> that aims to win a battle which is still primarily a ground (or naval) battle.  We often call this kind of airpower &#8216;close air support&#8217; but not all tactical airpower is CAS.  If you instead use airpower to <em>shape</em> ground operations &#8211; for instance by attacking infrastructure (like bridges or railroads) or by bombing enemy units to force them to stay put (often by forcing them to move only at night) &#8211; that&#8217;s <em>operational</em> airpower.  The most common form of this kind of airpower is &#8216;interdiction&#8217; bombing, which aims to slow down enemy ground movements so that friendly units can out-maneuver them in larger-scale sweeping movements.</p>



<p>By contrast <em>strategic</em> airpower aims to produce effects at the strategic (that is, top-most) level on its own.  Sometimes that is quite blunt: strategic airpower aims to win the war on its own without reference to ground forces, or at least advance the ball on winning a conflict or achieving a desired end-state (that is, the airpower may not be the <em>only</em> thing producing strategic effects).  Of course strategic effects can go beyond &#8216;winning the war&#8217; &#8211; coercing or deterring another power are both strategic effects as well, forcing the enemy to redefine their strategy.  That said, as we&#8217;ll see, this initially very expansive definition of strategic airpower really narrows quite quickly.  Aircraft cannot <em>generally </em>hold ground, administer territory, build trust, establish institutions, or consolidate gains, so using airpower rapidly becomes a question of &#8216;what to bomb&#8217; because delivering firepower is what those aircraft can do.</p>



<p>As an aside, this sort of cabined definition of airpower and thus strategic airpower has always been frustrating to me.  It <em>is</em> how airpower is often discussed, so it&#8217;s how I am going to discuss it, but of course aircraft can move more than bombs.  Aircraft might move troops &#8211; that&#8217;s an operational use of airpower &#8211; but they can also move goods and supplies.  Arguably the most successful example of strategic airpower use anywhere, <em>ever</em> is the Berlin Airlift, which was a pure airpower operation that comprehensively defeated a major Soviet strategic aim, and yet the U.S. Air Force is far more built around strategic <em>bombing</em> than it is around strategic humanitarian airlift (it <em>does </em>the latter, but the Army and the Navy, rather than the Air Force, tend to take the lead in long-distance humanitarian operations).  <strong>Nevertheless that definition &#8211; excessively narrow, I would argue &#8211; is a clear product of the history of strategic airpower, so let&#8217;s start there</strong>.</p>



<p>And once again before we get started, a reminder that the conflict in Ukraine is not notional or theoretical but very real and is causing very real suffering, including displacing large numbers of Ukrainians as refugees, both within Ukraine and beyond its borders. If you want to help, consider donating to Ukrainian aid organizations like <a href="https://razomforukraine.org/">Razom for Ukraine</a> or to the <a href="https://donate.redcrossredcrescent.org/ua/donate/~my-donation?_cv=1">Ukrainian Red Cross.</a>  As we&#8217;re going to see here, airpower offers no quick solution for the War in Ukraine for either party, but the recent Russian shift to air attacks on civilian centers sadly promises more suffering and more pressing need for humanitarian assistance for Putin&#8217;s many victims.</p>



<p>Finally, a content warning: what we&#8217;re discussing today is largely (though not entirely) the application of airpower against civilian targets because it turns <em>usually</em> what &#8216;strategic&#8217; airpower ends up being.  This is a discussion of the theory, which means its going to be pretty bloodless, but nevertheless this topic <em>ought</em> to be uncomfortable.</p>



<p>On with our topic, starting with the question of where the idea of strategic airpower comes from.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">That Damned Trench Stalemate Again!</h2>



<p>In my warfare survey, I have a visual gag where for a week and a half after our WWI lecture, every lecture begins with the same slide showing an aerial photograph (below) of the parallel trenches of the First World War because <em>so much</em> of the apparatus of modern warfare exists as a response, a desperate need <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/09/17/collections-no-mans-land-part-i-the-trench-stalemate/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/09/17/collections-no-mans-land-part-i-the-trench-stalemate/">to never, <em>ever</em> do the trench stalemate again</a>.  And that&#8217;s where our story starts.</p>

On the one hand the difference between the flimsy, unarmed artillery scout planes of the war&#8217;s early days and the purpose-built bombers and fighters of the war&#8217;s end was dramatic.  On the other hand the platforms available at the end of the war remained very limited.  Once again we can use a late-war bomber like the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farman_F.50" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farman_F.50"> Farman F.50 </a>&#8211; introduced too late to actually do much fighting in WWI &#8211; as an example of the best that could be done.  It has a range of 260 miles &#8211; too short to reach deep into enemy country &#8211; and a bomb load of just 704lbs.  Worse yet it was slow and couldn&#8217;t fly very high, making it quite vulnerable.  It is no surprise that bombers like this didn&#8217;t break the trench stalemate in WWI or win the war.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, anyone paying attention could already see that these key characteristics &#8211; range, speed, ceiling and the all-important bomb-load &#8211; were increasingly rapidly.  And while the politicians of the 1920s often embraced the assumption that the War to End All Wars had in fact banished the scourge of war from the Earth &#8211; or at the very least, from the corner of it they inhabited such that war would now merely be a thing <em>they </em>inflicted on other, poorer, less technologically advanced peoples &#8211; the military establishment did not.  European peace had always been temporary; the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Congress of Vienna (1815) had not ended war in Europe, so why would the Treaty of Versailles (1919)?  There had always been another war and they were going to plan for it!  And they were going to plan in the <em>sure knowledge</em> that the bombers the next war would be fought with would be <em>much</em> larger, faster, longer ranged and more powerful than the bombers they knew.</p>



<p>One of those interwar theorists was Giulio Douhet (1869-1930), an Italian who had served during the First World War.  Douhet wasn&#8217;t the only bomber advocate or even the most influential at the time &#8211; in part because Italy was singularly unprepared to actually capitalize on the bomber as a machine, given that it was woefully under-industrialized and bomber-warfare was perhaps the <em>most</em> industrial sort of warfare on offer at the time (short of naval warfare) &#8211; but his writings exemplify a lot of the thinking at the time, particularly his <em>The Command of the Air</em> (1921).<span id='easy-footnote-2-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15716' title='&lt;em&gt;Il dominio dell-aria&lt;/em&gt;.  If that title sounds like it is echoing A.T.

Douhet was so exceptionally irritating that he was court-martialed for it, his career surviving only because Italy was short of officers during the First World War.  That seems oddly common among the early airpower/bombing advocates: they tended to be persistent, but quite caustic men.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like many theorists at the time, Douhet was thinking about how to avoid a repeat of the trench stalemate, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/10/08/collections-luigi-cadorna-was-the-worst/" data-type="post" data-id="9596">which as you may recall was particularly bad for Italy</a>.  For Douhet, there was a geometry to this problem; land warfare was two dimensional and thus it was possible to simply <em>block</em> armies.  But aircraft &#8211; specifically <em>bombers</em> &#8211; could move in three dimensions; the sky was not merely larger than the land but <em>massively so</em> as a product of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law"> square-cube law</a>.  To stop a bomber, the enemy must <em>find</em> the bomber and in such an enormous space finding the bomber would be next to impossible, especially as flight ceilings increased.  In Britain, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Baldwin" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> summed up this vision by famously quipping, &#8220;no power on earth can protect the man in the street from being bombed.  Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through.&#8221;  And technology seemed to be moving this way as the possibility for long-range aircraft carrying heavy loads and high altitudes became more and more a reality in the 1920s and early 1930s.</p>



<p>Consequently, Douhet assumed there could be no effective defense against fleets of bombers (and thus little point in investing in air defenses or fighters to stop them).  Rather than wasting time on the heavily entrenched front lines, stuck in the stalemate, they could fly <em>over</em> the stalemate to attack the enemy directly.  In this case, Douhet imagined these bombers would target &#8211; with a mix of explosive, incendiary and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/03/20/collections-why-dont-we-use-chemical-weapons-anymore/" data-type="post" data-id="2600">poison gas munitions</a>) the &#8220;peacetime industrial and commercial establishment; important buildings, private and public; transportation arteries and centers; and certain designated areas of civilian population.&#8221;  This onslaught would in turn be so severe that the populace would force its government to make peace to make the bombing stop.  Douhet went so far to predict (in 1928) that just 300 tons of bombs dropped on civilian centers could end a war in a month; in <em>The War of 19&#8211;</em> he offered a scenario where in a renewed war between Germany and France where the latter surrendered under bombing pressure before it could even mobilize.  <strong>Douhet imagined this, somewhat counterintuitively, as a more humane form of war</strong>: while the entire effort would be aimed at butchering as many civilians as possible, he thought doing so would end wars quickly and thus result in less death.</p>



<p>Clever ideas to save lives by killing <em>more </em>people are surprisingly common and unsurprisingly rarely turn out to work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Assumptions and Institutions</h2>



<p>Now before we move forward, I think we want to unpack that vision just a bit, because there are actually quite a few assumptions there.  First, Douhet is assuming that there will be no way to locate or intercept the bombers in the vastness of the sky, that they will be able to accurately navigate to and strike their targets (which are, in the event, major cities) and be able to carry sufficient explosive payloads to destroy those targets.  But the largest assumption of all is that the application of explosives to cities would lead to collapsing civilian morale and peace; it was a wholly untested assumption, which was about to become an <em>extremely</em> well-tested assumption.  But for Douhet&#8217;s theory to work, all of those assumptions in the chain &#8211; lack of interception, effective delivery of munitions, sufficient munitions to deliver and bombing triggering morale collapse &#8211; needed to be true.  <strong>In the event, none of them were</strong>.</p>



<p>What Douhet couldn&#8217;t have known was that one of those assumptions would already be in the process of collapsing before the next major war.  The British Tizard Commission tested the first Radio Detection and Finding device successfully in 1935, what we tend to now call radar (for RAdio Detection And Ranging).  Douhet had assumed the only way to actually <em>find</em> those bombers would be the venerable Mk. 1 Eyeball and indeed they made doing so a formidable task (the Mk. 1 Ear was actually a more useful device in many cases).  But radar changed the game, allowing the detection of flying objects at much greater range and with a fair degree of precision.  The British started planning and building a complete network of radar stations covering the coastline in 1936, what would become the &#8216;Chain Home&#8217; system.  <strong>The bomber was no longer untrackable</strong>.</p>

These radar stations were built in a network to provide overlapping coverage.  They were paired with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observer_Corps" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observer_Corps">observation posts</a> on the coast using binoculars and listening for engine sounds to spot low-flying planes that might evade radar detection.  That information was then processed through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowding_system" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowding_system">Dowding system</a> to vector in intercepts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That was in turn matched by changes in the design of the bomber&#8217;s great enemy, fighters.  Douhet had assumed big, powerful bombers could not only be undetected, but would fly at altitudes and speeds which would render them difficult to intercept.  Fighter designs, however, advanced just as fast.  First flown in 1935, the Hawker Hurricane could fly at 340mph and up to 36,000 feet, plenty fast and high enough to catch the bombers of the day.  The German Bf 109, deployed in 1937 (the same year the Hurricane saw widespread deployment) was actually a touch <em>faster</em> and could make it to 39,000 feet.  If the bomber could be <em>found</em>, it could absolutely be <em>engaged</em> by such planes and those fighters, being faster and more maneuverable could absolutely shoot the bomber down.  Indeed, when it came to it over Britain and Germany, bombers proved to be <em>horribly</em> vulnerable to fighters if they weren&#8217;t well escorted by their own long-range fighters.</p>



<p>Cracks were thus already appearing in Douhet&#8217;s vision of wars won entirely through the air. <strong> But the question had already become tied up in institutional rivalries in quite a few countries, particularly Britain and the United States</strong>.  After all, if future wars would be won by the air, that implied that military spending &#8211; a scarce and shrinking commodity in the interwar years &#8211; ought to be channeled away from ground or naval forces and towards fledgling air forces like the Royal Air Force (RAF) or the US Army Air Corps (soon to be the US Army Air Forces, then to be the US Air Force), either to fund massive fleets of bombers or fancy new fighters to <em>intercept</em> massive fleets of bombers or, ideally both.  Just as importantly, if airpower could achieve <em>independent strategic effects</em>, it made no sense to tie the air arm to the ground by making it a subordinate part of a country&#8217;s army; the generals would always prioritize the ground war.  <strong>Consequently, <em>strategic</em> airpower, as distinct from any other kind of airpower, became the crucial argument for both the <em>funding</em> and <em>independence</em> of a country&#8217;s air arm</strong>.  That matters of course because, while we are discussing <em>strategic</em> airpower here, it is not &#8211; as you will recall from above &#8211; the only kind.  But it was the only kind <em>which could justify a fully independent Air Force</em>.</p>



<p>Upton Sinclair once quipped that, &#8220;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on him not understanding it.&#8221;  Increasingly the salaries of airmen in the United States and Britain depended on understanding that strategic bombing &#8211; again, distinct from other forms of airpower  &#8211; could work, <em>would work</em> and would be a war winner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Theory Is Tested</h2>



<p>The Second World War provided the &#8216;opportunity&#8217; for the theory to be tested, frankly to destruction.  To the destruction of quite a lot of things, the theory included.  Nazi Germany conducted the first terror bombings<span id='easy-footnote-3-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15716' title='Of the war in Europe, not in general.  Terror bombing itself was not new at this point, having been done all the way back in WWI with zeppelins.'><sup>3</sup></a></span> &#8211; that is, bombing attacks on civilian targets designed to sow fear and demoralize the enemy &#8211; against Poland in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Wielu%C5%84" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Wielu%C5%84">the opening hours of the war</a>, though in the event the collapse of the badly outnumbered and outgunned Polish army on the ground made the Nazi terror bombings (like most of what the Nazis did) an exercise in pointless, excessive cruelty.</p>



<p>Instead the first real test of the theory came in an odd form: the Battle of Britain (July-October, 1940).  The oddity here is that the ostensible initial goal of German air operations against Britain was not to compel surrender by demoralizing the populace, but rather to open Britain to the credible threat of invasion by destroying the Royal Air Force and prohibiting the Royal Navy from operating within range of German airbases.  In this sense it would have been the <em>threat</em> of a land invasion which would have achieved the strategic effect, with airpower merely enabling that operation.</p>



<p>That of course isn&#8217;t how it turned out.  While the Luftwaffe initially began with attacks against shipping, progressing to attacks on airbases and air production, beginning in August 1940 the Luftwaffe began escalating attacks on civilian areas (the degree to which that was intentional remains contested).  The British responded with bombing raids against Berlin, at which point Hitler and Göring retaliated with an intensive campaign of urban bombing which would become known as the &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz">blitz</a>.&#8217;  Hitler would claim these attacks were reprisals (<em>Vergeltungsangriffen</em>, &#8216;revenge attacks&#8217;) for the British bombing Berlin, which was frankly pretty rich hypocrisy coming from the fellow who had terror-bombed the Poles in 1939.<span id='easy-footnote-4-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15716' title='I think it is really worth stressing: &lt;strong&gt;both the Germany and Japan were using terror-bombing &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; before they were targeted by it&lt;/strong&gt;, the Germans against Poland and the Japanese in China.  One can argue that bombing civilians is nevertheless immoral in all cases, just as one might argue that no one should ever stab someone with a knife in a bar.  However, if a fellow draws a knife in a bar and begins stabbing the patrons, it is hardly reasonable &lt;em&gt;for that same fellow&lt;/em&gt; to cry foul play when the other patrons draw their knives and just so happen to have much bigger knives.  It is, at that point, too late for the first fellow to opine on the fundamental incivility of knifing people.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>  But that progression brings an interesting distinction here between <em>intentional</em> strategies of using bombing to collapse morale and the reversion to civilian bombing as pure <em>punishment</em>.  As we&#8217;ll see, it is a predictable human response when an effort is failing to attempt to punish the opponent for the temerity of not losing; this behavior is especially pronounced in personalistic dictatorships but certainly not restricted to them.  Naturally bombing against civilian targets, since its introduction, has often been the means of this sort of punishment response; more broadly this kind of thing fits into the error of &#8216;<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/19/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-viii-the-mind-of-saruman/" data-type="post" data-id="3596">emotive strategy</a>,&#8217; which we&#8217;ve discussed before.</p>

<p>Nazi strategic incoherence aside, the Blitz was revealing in quite a few ways.  First, it demonstrated quite effectively that the bomber would <em>not</em> in fact always get through &#8211; or more correctly that a defender could inflict meaningful attrition on bombers through ground-based anti-air and (even more importantly) fighter intercept.  Radar (in the form of the Chain Home system) was particularly important for allowing interceptors to be concentrated on incoming bomber formations rather than having to disperse to search the sky.  Second, German efforts to put bombs on specific industrial targets were, if you will pardon the pun, decidedly hit-or-miss.  Moreover it turned out that destroying a city required <em>a lot more bombs</em> than anyone had anticipated; <strong>the Luftwaffe dropped about 40,000 tons of bombs on London during the Blitz &#8211; <em>133 time</em></strong><em>s</em><span id='easy-footnote-5-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-15716' title='This figure is going to keep going up to increasingly incredible degrees.'><sup>5</sup></a></span> <strong>the quantity Douhet thought would compel a country to surrender &#8211; and didn&#8217;t manage to permanently destroy or even substantially hinder the city</strong>.  British production <em>rose</em> over the period, albeit more slowly than it might otherwise have.</p>



<p>But perhaps most ominously for the theory, the Blitz didn&#8217;t seem to have meaningfully dampened British morale.  Indeed, to the contrary &#8211; and get ready to hear this phrase a lot &#8211; <strong>being bombed hardened civilian will to resist</strong>.  This hardly discredited the theory though, least of all among the British (or the soon-to-be-in-the-war Americans) who promptly decided to test it themselves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Theory Is Tested&#8230;Again</h2>



<p>The Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) both conducted strategic bombing campaigns against Germany during WWII, though along ostensibly different principles.  In the United States, an air campaign expressly aimed at killing German civilians to compel surrender was politically unpalatable (there were fewer such compunctions against doing this to Japan, due in no small part to racism), so the theory the USAAF went with was aimed at <em>production</em> rather than <em>morale</em>, which had emerged in the then U.S. Army Air Corps during the 1930s.  The idea, informally called &#8216;Industrial Web Theory,&#8217; was that an enemy&#8217;s industrial capacity was a fairly fragile web which could be disrupted by striking key nodes and that these disruptions would cause military production &#8211; ammunition, weapons, fuel and all of the other necessary things for ground warfare &#8211; to come to a near-halt, depriving the enemy of the ability to field a modern army and thus forcing them to surrender.  Doing this would require being able to accurately deliver bombs to smaller targets (factories and railyards, not cities) but the USAAF was confident that such accuracy was possible, particularly with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norden_bombsight" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norden_bombsight">Norden bomb sight</a>, if bombing was done by day.</p>



<p>The British, meanwhile, were in a different situation.  Unlike the USA, with its near infinite capabilities to build bombers and train air crews, Britain was limited in both; daylight bombing promised unsustainable casualty rates and so the RAF would have to bomb at night.  That in turn meant accuracy was out of the question; cities went dark at night leaving bombers at high altitudes with no visible landmarks to navigate by.<span id='easy-footnote-6-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-15716' title='You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; try dead reckoning, but that struggled to put bombs on the right city, much less the right building.'><sup>6</sup></a></span>  Meanwhile, the experience of the Blitz had left British politicians and the public with far fewer qualms about &#8216;morale bombing&#8217; (an Allied euphemism for terror bombing) in return.  So the RAF settled on &#8216;area bombing&#8217; as a strategy, which was essentially strategic bombing along the lines suggested by Douhet: bomb until civilian morale cracked.</p>

<p>These strategies and their applications remain deeply controversial, as you might imagine.  I find one of the better arguments for the value of bombing to be Richard Overy&#8217;s chapter in<a href="https://amzn.to/3rO1Ibh" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3rO1Ibh"> <em>Why The Allies Won</em></a> (1995); the degree to which his case is muted and partial speaks <em>volumes</em>.  In practice while strategic bombing may have achieved positive outcomes for the Allies, they were mostly unintended outcomes, though to be fair to Allied leadership in many cases it couldn&#8217;t have been clear ahead of time how poorly the theory would perform.<span id='easy-footnote-7-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-15716' title='I must admit I do not generally extend this charity to fellows like Arthur Harris or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_LeMay&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_LeMay&quot;&gt;Curtis LeMay&lt;/a&gt; who were fairly explicit that their goal was to simply kill as many civilians as possible in order to end the war.  At the same time, I thank heavens I have never been and presumably never will be in a position to be forced to weigh ending a war more quickly and thus saving some of the soldiers under my command against grievous civilian casualties.'><sup>7</sup></a></span>  Instead, just about every key assumption that formed the foundation of morale bombing and industrial web theory and Douhet&#8217;s whole apparatus itself turned out to be wrong.</p>



<p>First, the accuracy to enable pin-point targeting of industrial facilities simply wasn&#8217;t there.  By way of example (drawn from the chapter on strategic bombing in Lee, <a href="https://amzn.to/3CnS9Vc" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3CnS9Vc"><em>Waging War</em> </a>(2016)), in 1944 the allies attempted from May to November in a series of raids to destroy an oil plant in Leuna, Germany.  The plant was 1.2 square miles in total size and yet <em>84%</em> of all bombs missed.  In the USAAF, the problem of accuracy led to a shift in tactics, from aiming for factories to area bombing intended to &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehousing" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehousing">de-house workers</a>,&#8217; which is an incredibly bloodless euphemism for daylight bombing raids against dense urban housing.  <strong>Consequently, industrial damage was <em>far</em> less than was hoped.  Instead of falling, German production continued to rise &#8211; indeed, it <em>tripled</em></strong> &#8211; until territorial losses to the advancing Soviet and Allied armies finally curtailed production.  Overy argues, persuasively, I think, that bombing did serve to stunt German production growth, but the <em>strategic</em> effect of disabling German industry to the point that the war couldn&#8217;t be continued was wildly, overwhelmingly out of reach.  <strong>The opponent could, after all, <em>react</em>, dispersing and protecting industry, limiting the impact of bombing campaigns.</strong>  Industrial bombing thus achieved <em>something</em>, but it is unclear if it achieved anything to be worth the <em>tremendous</em> investment in vast fleets of bombers necessary to do it.</p>



<p><strong>Meanwhile it rapidly become apparent that the unescorted bomber would most certainly <em>not</em> always get through.</strong>  The Allies lost some <em>37,000</em> aircraft in the strategic bombing campaign.  Now as Overy notes this actually led to one of the unintended successes of the effort: American and British bombers diverted massive amounts of German aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery away from the Eastern Front where the Germans badly needed it.  By the end of 1943, there were 55,000 AA guns (including 75% of the 88mm guns, which were very effective anti-tank guns as well), while German aircraft production shifted over to primarily producing fighters, with bomber production falling from 50% of the total in 1942 to just 18% in 1944.  And even then, Germany simply could not match American production potential, especially as long-range escorts became available.  <strong>In practice one of the most important contributions of the strategic bombing effort was, ironically, luring the Luftwaffe into the air where it could be destroyed</strong>; the effort of trying to stop the bombers essentially wore the Luftwaffe down to a nub, greatly easing the path of <em>ground </em>operations (including the D-Day invasion).  This was <em>very much</em> not the intended outcome of operations, but perhaps the most useful thing strategic bombing accomplished in the war.</p>

Note that despite the relatively clear conditions, the destruction is spread over dozens of city blocks around the factory.  While the Norden bomb-sight was better than what had come before, in combat conditions it simply was not up to the task of putting bombs on factories from high altitude.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Finally, in the aftermath of the war, efforts to survey the morale impact of the bombing largely concluded that</strong> &#8211; <em>wait for it</em> &#8211; <strong>being bombed hardened civilian will to resist</strong>.  Together the allies had dropped some 2,500,000 tons of bombs &#8211; <em>eight thousand times</em><span id='easy-footnote-8-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-15716' title='I told you it would keep going up.'><sup>8</sup></a></span> the quantity Douhet predicted would induce surrender &#8211; and the net effect of this was to increase German resolve to resist.  You would be forgiven for assuming that this would put to rest Douhet&#8217;s notion that with enough conventional bombs, one could collapse civilian will and end a conflict from the air.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We&#8217;re Still Testing This Theory!?</h2>



<p>Despite this, industrial web theory promptly became the doctrinal core of the newly independent United States Air Force in 1947.  Part of the reason was the apparently different course that strategic bombing had produced against Japan.  To the newly independent air force, nuclear weapons were simply a logical extension of strategic bombing and nuclear weapons had, in their view, worked to compel Japanese surrender.  Now I want to note again we&#8217;re not going to dive down the nuclear rabbit-hole here,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/03/11/collections-nuclear-deterrence-101/" data-type="post" data-id="11735"> we&#8217;ve done that before</a>.  I do want to note that current scholarship on the factors that led to Japanese surrender <a href="https://twitter.com/wc_quinn/status/1458891500344029189" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/wc_quinn/status/1458891500344029189">is very complex</a>; whatever simple summary of it you have heard &#8211; either that the atomic bombs definitely did or definitely did <em>not</em> lead directly to Japanese surrender &#8211; is almost certainly wrong given the complexity of the question.  But that complexity was a hard-won product of years of scholarship, based on documents which weren&#8217;t translated or available in the 1940s, had the new Air Force wanted to read them.  To many in the new Air Force the lesson was simple (and, again, wrong in it simplicity): strategic bombing worked, as it had compelled Japanese surrender without an invasion.  Few modern historians, I think, would agree with so simple a lesson.</p>



<p>Consequently the new Air Force oriented itself primarily around this strategic bombing mission, focused heavily on the use of nuclear weapons against civilian targets to compel surrender; the nuclear innovation would at last have the explosive power to deliver Douhet&#8217;s prophecy.  <strong>There is, of course, also a degree of institutional interest here: strategic bombing with nuclear weapons provided a ready justification for the creation of and continued funding of an independent Air Force, because it envisaged that Air Force would itself engage in independent combat operations, rather than merely engage in combat operations in support of ground forces</strong>.  Ironically, as I hinted at earlier, it is in this formative period that strategic airpower achieved what, as far as I can tell, is its only clear, unqualified success at producing strategic outcomes in the absence of ground force: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade">the Berlin Airlift</a> (1948-9) and to be fair <em>some</em> Air Force doctrine does recognize this, though it seems to me more often that definitions of airpower are oriented around kinetic effects (bombing) to the degree that other modes of non-kinetic airpower are marginalized.  Nevertheless <strong>strategic airpower in the Cold War Air Force largely meant strategic bombing, either to crush enemy will or disable enemy industry</strong>.</p>



<p>Industry bombing and industrial web theory was thus the framework the Air Force had going into both the Korean and Vietnam Wars.  Both wars presented a major problem: the industry actually sustaining the war effort wasn&#8217;t in the combat zone and couldn&#8217;t be attacked due to political concerns.  During the Korean War, North Korean forces were largely supplied by China and the USSR; attacking either might trigger a nuclear retaliation and so was rejected.  Instead, the United States used a campaign of &#8216;air pressure&#8217; to try to compel a favorable peace, essentially resorting &#8211; as they had in WWII &#8211; to a Douhet-style bombing attack on the will to continue the fight when industrial bombing failed.  This campaign was escalated to attacks on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_the_Sui-ho_Dam" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_the_Sui-ho_Dam">key dams</a>, which could in turn damage not only power generation but also cause flooding and famine.  In practice these efforts do not seem to have been a major factor in the eventual success of armistice negotiations.</p>



<p>In Vietnam, the same problem complicated any effort at industrial bombing: the factories that supplied the North Vietnamese forces (both the regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Army_of_Vietnam" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Army_of_Vietnam">PAVN </a>and irregular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong">NLF</a>)  were in China and especially the USSR.  Moreover the population was not broadly dependent on centralized utilities (like electricity) which could be bombed.  Nevertheless, the United States embarked upon &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a>,&#8217; (1965-1968) a bombing campaign over parts of North Vietnam which aimed to steady increase &#8216;pressure&#8217; by bombing North Vietnamese industrial and transportation targets, as well as degrading North Vietnam&#8217;s air defenses.   Supporters of the campaign at the time and subsequently have long claimed that the effort was hindered by political constraints which set certain targets and areas as off-limits, but it is hard not to also note that pulling the People&#8217;s Republic of China directly into the war would have been a pretty catastrophic failure and presented dangerous escalation scenarios given that the PRC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction">had become a nuclear power in 1964</a>.  The political constraints were real and as we&#8217;ve discussed, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/19/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-viii-the-mind-of-saruman/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/19/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-viii-the-mind-of-saruman/">political (that is, <em>strategic)</em> realities must dictate operational and tactical </a>decisions, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Nevertheless over the course of the operation the United States dropped some 643,000 tons of bombs on North Vietnam, a fraction of the even larger total used during the entire war (though the great majority of that larger total, around 8,000,000 tons, were dropped on targets outside of North Vietnam).  The net effect on the industrial basis of the war effort was not significant.  Meanwhile, Mark Clodfelter has argued (inter alia), in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3EKcXZT" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3EKcXZT">The Limits of Air Power</a></em> (2006) that the campaign actually <em>harmed</em> US political objectives and <em>helped</em> North Vietnamese goals, securing North Vietnam&#8217;s firm support from both its populace and its international sponsors while at the same time dividing the American public and thus sapping support for the war.  Once again &#8211; wait for it &#8211; <strong>being bombed hardened civilian will to resist</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But Maybe It Could Work For Us?</h2>



<p>Subsequent efforts in Vietnam may have been more successful.  &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Linebacker" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Linebacker">Linebacker</a>&#8221; &#8211; a bombing campaign in 1972 aimed primarily at interdicting the transportation of supplies from North Vietnam to the fighting in South Vietnam &#8211; helped to force North Vietnam to peace talks.  A second operation, creatively named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Linebacker_II" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Linebacker_II">Linebacker II</a> (also 1972) was also used when talks stalled to try to compel North Vietnamese leadership to compromise.  What I find particularly striking about both efforts here &#8211; and keep a pin in this for a moment because we&#8217;ll come back to it &#8211;<strong> is that they achieved their goals, but their goals were <em>limited</em> and focused on <em>political leadership</em> rather than popular support for the war</strong>.  That is already a major revision from Douhet&#8217;s vision of producing strategically significant popular morale collapse.  They didn&#8217;t convince North Vietnam to completely abandon its goal of reunification through military force &#8211; that would happen just three years later in 1975 &#8211; but rather merely convinced North Vietnamese leaders to essentially make fairly minor modifications to short-term goals and timetables, mostly a mere delay.</p>



<p>Strategic airpower was <em>supposed</em> to be the lever that could move mountains and yet by end of the 1970s the best it had managed to do was shift a falling stone a few feet to the right (though it ended up falling in the same place in the end).</p>



<p>However, in the push to effectively target North Vietnamese logistics, the United States had begun developing increasingly precise delivery systems for its bombs as well as progressively more sophisticated observation and targeting technology (though, as we&#8217;ll see, these don&#8217;t always develop in the order one would like).  More accurate systems made it possible to contemplate engaging a wider range of targets.  Consequently by the time the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War"> first Gulf War </a>(1991) rolled around, it was possible to contemplate a new kind of strategic airpower.

<p><strong>The idea in application was that by striking the inner rings &#8211; consisting of national leadership, communications and key industrial infrastructure (not <em>all</em> of the industry, but a few key components of it) &#8211; it would be possible to paralyze a country, causing it to collapse and thus &#8211; as is always the promise of strategic airpower &#8211; winning the war from the air.</strong>  It&#8217;s hard not to see this as some ways a strategic extrapolation of the sort of operational-tactical paralysis envisaged by<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/03/20/collections-why-dont-we-use-chemical-weapons-anymore/" data-type="post" data-id="2600"> Air Land Battle</a>, but raised to the strategic level and applied from the air.  This model was created for a very specific air campaign and so was immediately tested <em>in that air campaign</em>.</p>



<p><strong>On the one hand, the air campaign over Kuwait and Iraq in 1991 was<em> </em>clearly effective</strong>; Coalition forces achieved victory in the Gulf War far faster and at far less cost than had generally been anticipated.  <strong>On the other hand, air operations in both the first Gulf War and then more than a decade later during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, it was not clear that any kind of <em>strategic</em> paralysis was achieved</strong>.  The DoD&#8217;s own report, issued in 1993 (Cohen and Keaney, <em><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR7Iusmej6AhU6GFkFHTDNDIoQFnoECBYQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.defense.gov%2F2010%2FSep%2F27%2F2001329801%2F-1%2F-1%2F0%2FAFD-100927-061.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DLPtpf6OWlzfAGHgNKi_Q" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR7Iusmej6AhU6GFkFHTDNDIoQFnoECBYQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.defense.gov%2F2010%2FSep%2F27%2F2001329801%2F-1%2F-1%2F0%2FAFD-100927-061.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DLPtpf6OWlzfAGHgNKi_Q">Gulf War Air Power Survey</a></em> (1993)) noted first that only some 15% of strikes were against &#8216;strategic&#8217; targets, while strikes against Iraqi ground forces consumed 56% of strikes; as Coalition air forces exhausted their list of strategic targets, they switched over to strikes against ground forces.  </p>

The low percentage of Core Strategic Air Attacks is a consequence of Coalition air forces essentially running out their list of strategic targets without achieving a strategic effect, then shifting to interdiction and close air support missions (the Air Attack of Surface Forces percentage) for the rest of the conflict.  Airpower had worked, but <strong>strategic </strong>airpower had failed.  Again.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite effectively running out the entire list of strategic targets, Cohen and Keaney nevertheless conclude that strategic effects were broadly not achieved.  Despite striking the Iraqi communications network with more than 580 strikes, &#8220;the Iraqi government had been able to continue launching Scuds&#8221; and &#8220;sufficient &#8216;connectivity&#8217; persisted for Baghdad to order a withdrawal from the theater [Kuwait] that included some redeployments aimed at screening the retreat.&#8221;  Consequently, &#8220;these attacks clearly fell short of fulling the ambitious hope&#8221; to &#8220;put enough pressure on the regime to bring about its overthrow and completely sever communications between Baghdad and their military forces.&#8221; <strong> Instead airpower continued to show its greatest impact through <em>non-strategic</em> effects: destroying or disorienting enemy ground forces in order to make the advance of friendly ground forces quicker and easier</strong>.  That pattern would, by the by, functionally repeat in the 2003 invasion of Iraq as well.  <strong>Good old interdiction and close air support helped to achieve what strategic bombing, after more than a half century of attempts, still could not.</strong></p>



<p>The other common examples of the strategic use of airpower are the two NATO interventions against Serbia, first over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Deliberate_Force" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Deliberate_Force">Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995</a> and then in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia">Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo in 1999</a>.  But a distinction here has to be made: in Bosnia, NATO intervention in the air was in support of a significant ground force tasked with implementing UN resolutions establishing no-fly zones and maritime embargoes.  When NATO escalated to direct bombing with Operation Deliberate Force, it was primarily close air support, supporting ground operations by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Army, not as an independent strategic operation.  So we may safely set that aside.</p>



<p>That leaves Operation Allied Force in response to Serbian ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1999.  As<a href="https://twitter.com/mewalters101/status/1579935050019536896" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/mewalters101/status/1579935050019536896"> Mary Elizabeth Walters &#8211; an expert in this particular conflict &#8211; noted recently on Twitter</a>, the air campaign was initially aimed at degrading the Serbian military&#8217;s ability to function but rapidly switched to bombing &#8216;dual use&#8217; infrastructure in an effort to coerce Slobodan Milošević.  While civilian casualties absolutely happened and there were a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grdelica_train_bombing" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grdelica_train_bombing">serious </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade">mistakes </a>in targeting or timing, this was not an effort at Douhet-style morale bombing.  Instead the aim was to shift Milošević&#8217;s strategic calculus both by raising the cost of further ethnic cleansing but also to undermine his support among the key elites who <em>owned</em> all of the infrastructure that was getting blown up.  And it worked in altering Milošević&#8217;s political calculus (though his lack of international support was also a factor) but it did not succeed in <em>immediately </em>causing the collapse of his regime (though that did happen in late 2000 as as consequence of international sanctions damaging the economy).  At the same time, while the bombing campaign was happening, Serbian forces <em>accelerated</em> the ethnic cleansing campaign; efforts to slow down that process with strikes from the air largely failed due to difficulty in targeting the Serbian ground forces in the absence of a ground presence.<span id='easy-footnote-9-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-15716' title='Poor weather also played a role.'><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>

<p><strong>Overall then, the promise of strategic airpower, that it could win wars entirely or primarily from the skies, turns out so far to have been largely a mirage</strong>; in about 80 years of testing the theory, strategic bombing has yet to produce a clear example where it worked as intended.  Instead, strategic airpower must be one of the most thoroughly tested doctrines in modern warfare and it has failed nearly every test.  <strong>In particular, Douhet&#8217;s supposition that strategic bombing of civilian centers could force a favorable end to a conflict without the need to occupy territory or engage in significant ground warfare appears to be entirely unsupportable</strong>.<span id='easy-footnote-10-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-15716' title='And again, before someone shouts &amp;#8216;Japan in WWII,&amp;#8217; it seems necessary to note that Japan did not consider surrender until the Allies had effectively destroyed the Imperial Japanese Navy, dismembered much of the Japanese overseas empire, comprehensively cut Japanese shipping leading to critical shortages on the Japanese mainland and were clearly prepared to invade the Japanese homeland &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a final Japanese offensive in their land war in China had clearly failed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the USSR had declared war and invaded Japanese Manchuria, leaving the Japanese army on mainland Asia in a position where it was sure to be destroyed.  The promise of strategic airpower is not, &amp;#8216;if you are in a position to decisively end the war by annihilating the enemy&amp;#8217;s ground forces &amp;#8211; at great cost &amp;#8211; in the foreseeable future, strategic bombing &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; shorten the conflict.&amp;#8217;  It was &amp;#8216;win the war chiefly from the air.&amp;#8217;  &lt;strong&gt;The Pacific War was not chiefly won from the air&lt;/strong&gt;.'><sup>10</sup></a></span>  Nuclear weapons do not seem, so far, to have actually changed this; <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/03/11/collections-nuclear-deterrence-101/" data-type="post" data-id="11735">nuclear deterrence</a> does not aim at &#8216;will&#8217; in the Clausewitzian sense (drink!) but rather on altering the calculus of leaders and politicians through the threat of annihilation.  In the event of an actual conflict, the public&#8217;s desire not to be nuked &#8211; which would be the key target in a Douhet-style morale bombing campaign &#8211; appears to factor very little into actual decision-making.  No one checks the polls before intentionally embarking on nuclear war or in the <em>minutes</em> a leader might have to deliberate <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/03/11/collections-nuclear-deterrence-101/" data-type="post" data-id="11735">on ordering a second-strike.</a></p>



<p>Instead, efforts to use strategic bombing to coerce surrender have repeatedly shown that being bombed hardens civilian resolve to continue resisting.  <strong>By contrast, bombing can have <em>some</em> effect on industrial production, but only in wars where that production matters and is available <em>to be bombed</em></strong>; at the same time the impact of that industrial bombing is also likely to be sharply reduced by enemy efforts to shield industrial capacity from bombing and at the same time to prioritize military production with what industrial capacity remains.  Inducing full strategic paralysis has never been successfully demonstrated, although causing <em>disorientation</em>, making ground operations easier, by striking communications does seem to work but of course that isn&#8217;t quite a <em>strategic</em> use of airpower anymore, since it is in support of ground operations (which then achieve the strategic objectives).</p>



<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that independent airpower has <em>no</em> coercive effect.  <strong>However the coercive effect seems to be substantially more limited than the coercion available to ground forces (or naval forces for island nations), which makes sense given the greater ability of ground forces to remove resources from the enemy state</strong>.  After all, a bombed city has its production cut by some percentage, but a captured city provides <em>no</em> support for its former regime.  That limited coercive effect is fairly clearly displayed in the Linebacker operations, which convinced North Vietnam to delay, but not abandon, its plans for the conquest of the South.  Crucially, <strong>the coercive effect of these bombing efforts is not only limited, but it is also not delivered via popular will but rather through the political calculus of the leadership</strong> (again, politics not will, in the Clausewitzian sense; drink!), balancing the costs of sustaining aerial bombardment against the benefits of holding out.  Since those costs tend to be limited compared to ground conquest, the concessions these leaders are willing to make are also limited.  The use of strategic airpower to coerce can <em>deflect</em> but not reverse policy, but under conditions where a stronger power aims only to produce limited concessions from a weaker power, there is <em>some</em> promise in the use of airpower to create that deflection.  <strong>However, the repeated mistake militaries have made is attempting to use airpower as the lever to force <em>major</em> concessions or even total capitulation</strong>; the leverage for this appears to be nowhere near good enough.</p>



<p><strong>So why does strategic bombing, especially terror or &#8216;morale&#8217; bombing seem so resilient as an <em>idea</em> in so many militaries?</strong>  Well, the first answer goes back to institutional incentives and how the salaries of a great many aviators depend on <em>not understanding</em> just how weak a strategy strategic airpower is.  &#8220;The purpose of our air forces is to win wars&#8221; is a much better argument to take to political leaders for funding than &#8220;the purpose of our air forces is to support our ground forces.&#8221;  The latter implies that the <em>ground forces</em> should set priorities and that the air forces ought to, for the most part, subordinate their efforts to those priorities.  And of course given the choice of priorities, ground forces will tend to prioritize&#8230;ground forces, with deleterious career and prestige outcomes for everyone else.  Combine this with the fact that the sort of folks who join a military&#8217;s air branch &#8211; any military&#8217;s air branch &#8211; are going to tend to be the sort of people who <em>already</em> believe in airpower and it isn&#8217;t hard to see how strategic airpower (as distinct from other forms of airpower) rapidly becomes a solution in search of a problem.</p>



<p>The second answer seems to be that strategic airpower is both <em>intuitive</em> and <em>tempting</em>.  It is intuitive in that it makes a certain immediate sense, even though <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/mar05/misfires" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.apa.org/monitor/mar05/misfires">like many intuitive things it is not really true</a>.  <strong>Nevertheless it <em>feels</em> like it should work and moreover &#8211; and this is the tempting bit &#8211; it would be <em>really nice</em> (for some decision-makers) if it did work, since it would offer the promise of exerting a lot of strategic leverage without risking the casualties and unpredictable messiness of ground operations</strong>.  It might shorten horrible wars, or even bring and end to war itself (of course <em>in practice</em> it appears capable of neither of those things)!  And so the answer of &#8216;we can bomb the problem away&#8217; is always going to have an essential appeal even though it isn&#8217;t true, while the institutional incentives above practically guarantee that there will always be someone in the room who has an interest in <em>believing</em> and <em>advocating</em> for that &#8216;solution.&#8217;</p>



<p>Finally &#8211; and this is where I think we come back to the War in Ukraine &#8211;<strong> strategic bombing is emotionally satisfying even as it doesn&#8217;t work</strong>.  It is a human instinct, when another human is doing something you don&#8217;t like &#8211; like refusing to lose on the battlefield &#8211; to retaliate, to punish that person.  Strikes on civilian centers are perhaps the purest expression of this instinct, inflicting maximum <em>pain</em> (because civilian centers, unlike actual military targets, are not hardened against attack) at a minimum of risk and cost.  We&#8217;ve discussed this &#8216;strategic sin&#8217; before, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/19/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-viii-the-mind-of-saruman/" data-type="post" data-id="3596">terming it emotive strategy</a>, but humans are emotional beings and so the temptation to &#8216;punish&#8217; rather than pursue interests in a rational way will always exist.</p>



<p><strong>Russian forces in Ukraine appear to follow this pattern of &#8216;behavior &#8217;emotive strategy&#8217; quite clearly, responding to setbacks with intensified long-range attacks on civilian centers.</strong>  After the Kharkiv offensive stalled out, Russian forces began pounding the city with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_civilians_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#Bombing_of_Kharkiv" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_civilians_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#Bombing_of_Kharkiv"> artillery in strikes that did more damage to civilians than the defenders of the city</a>.  Likewise, Russian airstrikes against explicitly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol_hospital_airstrike" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol_hospital_airstrike">humanitarian </a>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol_theatre_airstrike" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol_theatre_airstrike">civilian </a>buildings escalated in Mariupol as the difficulty of taking the city escalated.  Most recently, Russian forces have responded to setbacks the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Kherson oblasts, as well as a Ukrainian strike on the Kerch Bridge<span id='easy-footnote-11-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-15716' title='Which, while we&amp;#8217;re here, as the primary logistics link between the Kherson front and Russia (the East-West running railroads from Donetsk to Kherson are all either cut by Ukraine or too close to the front lines to use effectively), was &lt;strong&gt;an obviously valid military target&lt;/strong&gt;.

A loitering munition like this is a really cheap way to take out an armored vehicle, but an <strong>extremely expensive</strong> way to bomb a city.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the same time, <em>industrial</em> bombing &#8211; which also has, at best, a somewhat mixed track record &#8211; isn&#8217;t an option for Russia for the same reasons it wasn&#8217;t an option for the United States in Vietnam or Korea: the industrial production which sustains the Ukrainian war effort is largely happening outside of Ukraine.  Ukraine&#8217;s <em>entire</em> GDP pre-war was $189bn nominal.  As of October 3rd, 2022, <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/">Ukraine has commitments of over $93bn in aid; $52.3bn of that is from the United States</a>, a country against which Putin has very little leverage and which he most certainly cannot safely bomb.  Assuming the United States&#8217; European partners can tough it through the difficult economic headwinds of this winter, it is entirely within NATO resources to supply and fund Ukraine&#8217;s war effort indefinitely; in fact in terms of United States military spending it is an absolute <em>steal</em>, neutralizing a major competitor for a tiny fraction of the overall military budget.  That aid (financial, military and humanitarian) moves through transit routes in NATO countries which are also effectively inviolate into western Ukraine where Russia has struggled to exert any serious airpower.  Consequently, even interdicting these supplies &#8211; an effort akin to attacks on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail">Ho Chi Minh Trail</a> during the Linebacker operations &#8211; is largely out of reach for Russia.  That leaves just the morale bombing that Russia is doing now.</p>



<p>Edit: Some of the comments have argued that the recent Russian strikes are instead focused on electrical infrastructure and thus either valid logistical military targets or that their primary effect would be to cause Ukrainian civilians to freeze to death in winter (somewhat contradictory points).  First, this is an excessively charitable reading of the pattern of Russian strikes; the power grid has been targeted, but hardly exclusively.  The October 10 flurry of strikes included a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/10/kyiv-missile-strikes-russia-ukraine-war/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/10/kyiv-missile-strikes-russia-ukraine-war/">residential apartment building in Zaporizhzhia, heavy civilian traffic in Taras Shevchenko Park, and some 35 private residential buildings</a>.  Which of course is consistent with a pattern of strikes that included, as noted here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol_hospital_airstrike" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol_hospital_airstrike">a children&#8217;s hospital in Mariupol</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Russia-ukraine-war-mariupol-theater-c321a196fbd568899841b506afcac7a1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/Russia-ukraine-war-mariupol-theater-c321a196fbd568899841b506afcac7a1">a civilian shelter in a theater</a>, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61778433" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61778433">use of cluster munitions fired into apartment blocks in Kharkiv</a> and so on.  Which, of course, is consistent with Russian air operations earlier in Syria, which infamously used used <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/world/middleeast/united-nations-syria-russia.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/world/middleeast/united-nations-syria-russia.html">U.N. lists of hospitals and other humanitarian facilities &#8211; designed to keep them out of the fighting</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/15/syria/russia-strategy-targeted-civilian-infrastructure" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/15/syria/russia-strategy-targeted-civilian-infrastructure"><em><strong>as a target list</strong></em> in order to force civilians to flee, in violation of the Laws of Armed Conflict</a>.  Which, of course, is consistent with Russian operations against the city of Grozny in 1999-2000, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grozny_(1999%E2%80%932000)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grozny_(1999%E2%80%932000)">where failure to take the city by assault led to it being &#8220;the most destroyed city on Earth&#8221; as Russian forces resorted to bombing and artillery to demolish it</a>.  The pattern here, where Russian forces resort to whatever available means to destroy civilian infrastructure and kills civilians when facing battlefield failure is well established and <em>at least</em> two decades old; I see no reason to play pretend that this pattern isn&#8217;t clear.  To the contrary, such consistency suggests <em>doctrine</em> &#8211; formal or informal &#8211; is at work here.  If the Russian strikes here are anemic now, it seems only to be because Ukraine still has a functioning air defense system; Russia has not hesitated to engage in terror-bombing against parts of Ukraine (and Syria and Chechnya) that didn&#8217;t.  Consequently, <em>at best</em>, Russia might claim to be waging an incompetent and woefully insufficient &#8216;industrial web&#8217; style bombing campaign; if so this seems doomed to fail too for the same reason such efforts in Vietnam failed: the industrial capacity which sustains Ukraine is not located in Ukraine.  But the pattern of Russian strikes and the history of Russian strategy in this regard leaves me disinclined to read these attacks very charitably and to instead read them as &#8216;punishment&#8217; bombings, which of course is <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/10/kyiv-missile-strikes-russia-ukraine-war/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/10/kyiv-missile-strikes-russia-ukraine-war/">exactly what Putin said they were</a></em>.</p>



<p><strong>How likely is this Russian effort to succeed? </strong> Well, what we&#8217;ve seen so far is that air campaigns dropping <em>millions</em> of tons of high explosives have generally failed to compel a civilian population to seek peace.  By contrast, a Shahed 136 drone carries a 40kg explosive payload.  For comparison that means it would take <em>ninety</em> Shahed 136 drones to equal the payload of a <em>single</em> B-17 Flying Fortress and <em>eight-eight thousand</em> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II">equal the explosive power of the February, 1945 raids against Dresden</a>.  Those are efforts which, I feel the need to stress,<strong> <em>didn&#8217;t work</em> to collapse German civilian morale</strong>.  Meanwhile the Shahed 136, while very cheap as a drone is <em>very expensive</em> as a bomb; at c. $20,000 a pop, matching the Dresden raids would require almost $2bn assuming the production capacity for that many drones existed (and it doesn&#8217;t).  As Russia&#8217;s distance from Ukraine&#8217;s key civilian centers grows, the cost of delivering explosives to them increases,<span id='easy-footnote-12-15716' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/21/collections-strategic-airpower-101/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-15716' title='Tube artillery is cheaper but shorter range than rocket artillery is cheaper but shorter range than cruise missiles and jets and so on.  The ratio of explosive to &amp;#8216;expensive things delivering the explosive&amp;#8217; shifts in favor of the latter as distance rises.'><sup>12</sup></a></span> reducing Russia to demonstration attacks that, while horrible, have little chance of inflicting harm on Ukraine at a level that is remotely meaningful in this sort of war.  </p>



<p><strong>Consequently these &#8216;punishment&#8217; strikes seem likely to merely harden Ukrainian will to resist and sustain international support for Ukraine; they are expensive and almost entirely counter-productive for Russia&#8217;s actual war aims</strong>.  Such attacks won&#8217;t degrade Ukrainian will to continue a fight that most Ukrainians believe they are winning, but it <em>will</em> generate headlines and images which will reinforce public opinion among Ukraine&#8217;s supporters that Putin&#8217;s war effort has to be defeated.  Crucially it <em>strengthens</em> arguments that NATO&#8217;s European members should tough it out through a difficult winter in response to manifest Russian inhumanity, the exact <em>opposite</em> of the outcome Putin needs.  At the same time, Russian resources are finite; every rocket, missile or drone lobbed into Kyiv (or other Ukrainian cities) is a valuable munition no longer ready for use on the front lines.  In many cases the munitions Putin is firing in these &#8216;revenge&#8217; strikes are fairly expensive, fairly scarce precision munitions.  The Shahed 136 is a lot cheaper than other long-range precision munitions, but one has to imagine that Russian troops would prefer Russian loitering munitions to try to target Ukrainian ground forces; longer-range precision platforms are <em>very </em>expensive.  <strong>As with much &#8217;emotive strategy,&#8217; the things that make Putin &#8216;feel better&#8217; push victory further away &#8211; or in this case, hasten defeat</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Which also explains neatly why Ukraine, despite being in a position to potentially lob munitions indiscriminately into cities like Belgorod, has mostly avoided doing that</strong>; Ukrainian forces having restricted themselves largely to clear logistics targets like ammunition and fuel depots or trainyards when striking beyond the front lines.  Strategically, Ukraine needs to degrade Russian will (keep drinking!) &#8211; both political and civilian &#8211; while sustaining the international support that enables it to continue fighting and upon which Ukraine must pin its hopes for post-war rebuilding.  Striking civilian targets, while perhaps emotionally satisfying to some after the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/06/russia-ukraine-atrocities-war-crimes/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/06/russia-ukraine-atrocities-war-crimes/">brutality of Russian actions in Ukraine</a>, would run counter to these goals: it would fragment Ukraine&#8217;s international support and potentially harden Russian public opinion in support of Putin and his war.  Instead, Ukraine remains focused on winning the war in the field, degrading Russian morale by demonstrating that the war is unwinnable.</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion then, the Russian escalation of air attacks on civilian targets seems unlikely to significantly alter the trajectory of the war beyond increasing the sum of human misery it inflicts</strong>.  &#8216;Morale bombing&#8217; of this sort, while coming with a long history, has an extremely low &#8211; arguably zero &#8211; success rate at achieving major political concessions.  The promise of achieving in the air what cannot be done on the ground continues to suffer from the simple fact that as humans do not live in the air, conditions on the ground have greater coercive power; aircraft can only raid, they cannot occupy and humans can tolerate a stunning amount of raiding if they believe victory is still possible on the other side of it.  The promise of strategic airpower remains just that: a promise, more frequently broken than kept.</p>



<p>The War in Ukraine seems set to prove once again that strategic bombing is no substitute for battlefield success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is the last part of a four part series (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/16/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-i-making-it-personal/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/23/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iia-rascally-vassals/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/">IIb</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/">IV</a>) examining the historical assumptions behind the popular medieval grand strategy game <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, made by Paradox Interactive.  In the previous sections, we&#8217;d laid out what <em>CKIII</em> does very well: building a simulated model (albeit a simplified one) of power and rule within fragmented medieval polities bound together by ties of vassalage.</p>



<p>By contrast this week will be a bit more spread out, as I want to talk about some of the things that <em>CKIII </em>leaves out with that tight focus on fragmented, vassalage-based polities.  Now we&#8217;re absolutely not going to get to <em>everything</em>.  For one, we&#8217;re not going to discuss Central and Southern Asia too much here; while they <em>are</em> somewhat in soft focus I both think it is fairly clear that they are very likely to get further &#8216;flavor packs&#8217; in the future (in the same way <em>EUIV</em> had spread out into less heavily played regions) and also because my own knowledge of medieval Asia is very thin beyond steppe nomads.  The other very large &#8216;area that I think the game misses &#8216;gap&#8217; that I don&#8217;t intend to address much here is institutional religion.  <em>CKIII</em> has mechanics for this and while I&#8217;d argue they&#8217;re a bit underdeveloped for the outsized role that religion, especially the Latin Church, played in the period, they exist as a basis for expansion.  Moreover, I am very much not a medieval church historian (a meaningful subfield) or an medieval literary historian (a subfield so large that at times it seems to be the <em>actual</em> field, with traditional medieval history as its subfield), so that sort of focus seems better left to dedicated medievalists.</p>



<p>What we are going to talk about here are a few areas closer to my research interests where I think <em>CKIII</em> is substantially less developed than it could be or where mechanics don&#8217;t work as well as I think they might to express the history of the period.  That makes for a bit of a grab bag, but we&#8217;re going to talk about how the game struggles to simulate actual <em>states</em>, how the innovation system as currently structured both compounds these problems but also plays into a somewhat teleological view of historical progression as a sequence of advances towards centralization, how the current military system flattens some of the interesting diversity in military-and-social structure in these polities and finally &#8211; and perhaps most importantly &#8211; how the game&#8217;s strong focus on the elite largely leaves out non-elite actors, both peasants and burghers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Heirs of Rome</h2>



<p>We can deal with the bigger omission which is actually the smaller issue: the Byzantines.  It seems necessary of course to note that the Byzzies (yes, I call them that) were clearly victims of necessary development decisions.  The fact is, game development on this scale is partly about managing scope in order to actually release the product before the heat-death of the universe.  With the decision to have non-Christian rulers playable at launch and to move a number of mechanics that were DLC in <em>CKII</em> to the base game (e.g. men-at-arms units), it was inevitable that certain things got left out of scope and clearly the Eastern Roman Empire (that is, Byzantium) was one of them.</p>



<p><strong>And, though it pains me to say it, this was the correct choice</strong>.  The ERE is, as we&#8217;ll see, a <em>weird</em> creature for this period, a figurative dinosaur walking the earth &#8211; great, terrible and terribly out of date &#8211; which means that any development time spent on crafting bespoke mechanics for it wouldn&#8217;t be applicable for <em>anyone else</em>.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15670' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15670' title='Though I think that they might be handy aspirational goals for players aiming to further centralize their own realms.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>  And of course there are player expectations to consider; nearly every historical Paradox game that I can recall has at some point gotten a Byzantine-themed patch or DLC, including games in which the Byzantine Empire didn&#8217;t exist or else ceased to exist within the first ten years of game start.  So very clearly a choice was made, probably very early in development, to leave detailed Byzantine mechanics for later content.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say that the Byzzies get <em>nothing</em> here.  On <em>launch</em>, what they did get was attached specifically to the Byzantine Empire title, but with the fleshing out of the culture system, those elements got moved into traditions for Greek culture (which makes a lot more sense and means that should some other culture seize the title, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade">as happened</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">twice</a>), they wouldn&#8217;t automatically inherit the unique Byzantine way of doing things).  In particular, Greek culture has two traditions that reflect this Roman inheritance.  The first, &#8216;Eastern Roman Legacy&#8217; enables the Cataphract men-at-arms unit, along with shifting Byzantine armies away from levies and towards (expensive) heavy infantry and heavy cavalry men-at-arms units.  The second, Byzantine Traditions, enables the limited Byzantine government features, like the &#8216;Born in the Purple&#8217; trait, a beefed-up short reign penalty (to reflect the greater instability of individual Byzantine rulers) and so on.  Finally, the Byzantines begin with primogeniture, which is actually a fairly significant gameplay change since so much of the early game in <em>CKIII</em> is spent managing partitive intermittence everywhere else.</p>

<p>All told this is essentially just a framed &#8216;Work in Progress&#8217; sign.  Everyone <em><strong>knows</strong></em> that a more focused, substantive Byzantine flavor-pack is likely at some point (though every time you ask, &#8220;Byz wen?&#8221; it gets delayed).  That said, I hope that when the Byzantine themed DLC does arrive, it isn&#8217;t just some features for the Byzantines, but instead takes the opportunity to interrogate the kind of polity the Byzantines had in this period and how that might work in <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s systems.  <strong>So what makes the Eastern Roman Empire different and how might that be represented?</strong></p>



<p>I have kept using the word &#8216;polity&#8217; instead of &#8216;state&#8217; in these posts because most medieval polities were not states; but arguably <strong>the Byzantine Empire <em>was</em> a state</strong>, with power at least notionally fully centralized in the person of the emperor, an inheritance from the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/28/collections-rome-decline-and-fall-part-ii-institutions/" data-type="post" data-id="11007">late Roman governance system</a>.  While emperors still had to delegate <em>command</em> (and were thus at risk from rogue generals), political <em>authority</em> remained centralized and the state retained that effective monopoly on the legitimate use of force, at least to the end of the Komnenos dynasty in 1180 (after which the Byzantine Empire begins to fragment).</p>

The outsized theme of Anatolikon is not an accident, but a reflection of the fact that this was the largest fragment of the Byzantine army to be formed into a theme, the successor to the primary eastern army, the army of the East (in Greek, <em>Anatole</em>, thus the theme of Anatolikon).</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the level that <em>CKIII</em> works on, the key institution here are the θέματα (<em>themata</em>, sing. θέμα) or <em>themes</em>, which became the key administrative and military divisions of what remains of the Eastern Roman Empire after the catastrophes of the seventh century.  The theme-system took the late Roman field armies and &#8211; beginning in Anatolia &#8211; tied them to specific districts, creating combined military-civilian administrative areas.  Ironically this was in some sense a return to the older Roman system of combined military-civilian authority in the person of a provincial governor, but the difference here is that the army itself was essentially <em>settled</em> in its theme, to act as an initial defense force.  Meanwhile, over time a new professional field army formed around the emperor, called the <em>tagmata</em>.  The commander of a <em>thema</em> was given the Greek title of <em>strategos</em>, &#8216;general.&#8217;  And the developers clearly have this system in mind; the duchy-title divisions in the Byzantine Empire look to be modeled on geographic division of the themes in the early 11th century.</p>

As you can compare them with the map above, there&#8217;s a clear effort here to try to replicate most of the themes on their original boundaries.</figcaption></figure>



<p>And so far this seems like the sort of local rule that <em>CKIII</em> simulates well, but the devil is in the details.  Unlike the rulers we&#8217;ve discussed in previous weeks, the were <em><strong>appointed administrators</strong></em>, not local rulers; they did not hold their positions by heredity, but by imperial appointment.  The emperor assigned someone the job of commanding a theme and could (in theory) revoke that appointment at any time.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that emperors could select <em>anyone</em>; the Byzantine military-aristocracy was fairly small and whereas civilian court administrators could often be elevated from bureaucrats (including eunichs), army command was expected to go to members of the landholding elite who guarded that privilege jealously.  However, while appointed, <em>strategoi</em> had essentially total control of their theme and of course some of them used that authority to turn their armies against the emperor.</p>



<p>Modeling that institution within <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s systems would be tricky.  The problem here is that <em>CKIII</em> has a system for <em>local</em> landholdings (barony-level titles) which it fundamentally connects to a system for administrative control over large regions (ducal-level titles) through the vassalage systems.  But that connection doesn&#8217;t exist in the Byzantine system; while <em>strategoi</em> had to be members of the large landholder class (the <em>dynatoi</em>, &#8216;the powerful ones&#8217;) they could be assigned <em>anywhere</em>, not merely where their holdings were.  Perhaps the truest way to reflect this system inside of <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s systems would be to have all of the count-level vassals in the empire serve as a pool from which the emperor could arbitrarily select to command specific themes, but that would almost certainly break the game&#8217;s systems, since you could have a situation where a landholder in, say, Hellas was the <em>strategos</em> of Anatolikon theme where one of the landholders in his theme was the <em>strategos</em> of Hellas.  The two characters would be both each other&#8217;s vassals <em>and</em> each other&#8217;s lieges.  At the same time, the system would struggle to reflect the way in which the <em>dynatoi</em> expanded their influence at the expense of the central government by steadily expanding their holdings at the expense not of each other, but of the freeholding farmer class.</p>



<p>Actually modeling this system would thus require severing territorial map holdings from the administration of levies and revenues, which is not something I think that <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s core structure can handle.  The previous game, <em>CKII</em>, modeled appointed officials by making the ducal-level titles (the <em>strategoi</em>) freely revocable by the emperor, allowing the player a much greater degree of freedom to customize their administration on the fly, while still limiting their choices to the holders of existing county titles (albeit generally encouraging that players select <em>strategoi</em> from their own themes, which was uncommon historically).  As systems go, that actually isn&#8217;t a terrible compromise and might serve as the foundation for more mechanics for <em>CKIII</em>.</p>



<p>I should note there is another kind of medieval polity that this system clearly struggles with and those are larger civic republics: situations in which civic town governance has grown to cover a large area and thus be a state in its own right.  The most obvious candidates here are the great Italian republics (Genoa, Venice, Pisa, Florence, etc.) but powerful towns made important vassals or even semi-independent realms all over Europe (<em>especially</em> in the Low Countries).  We&#8217;ll come back to this but the game has no effective way to simulate the very different way these pocket states worked either, even as powerful non-player entities.  Establishing a set of mechanics to try to reflect more centralized states might enable the game to represent some of the ways that these small civic polities often punched well above their weight by virtue of more effective civic mobilization and internal governance.</p>

<p>And developing those systems also matters not just for republics and the Byzantines, but also for the ability of the game to model increasingly centralized late-game polities.  Moreover, it will be crucial if the map ever aims to expand to include China (something long implied by the ragged eastward edge of the game map), which alternated between periods of fragmentation but also of strong centralized state organization during the period of the Middle Ages in Europe.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#8217;t fix all of the fairly obvious duct-tape solutions for the Byzantines, like needing to have unique early access to primogeniture or the problem that Byzantine crown authority begins at &#8216;autonomous vassals&#8217; without even having the <em>ability</em> to raise it to &#8216;high.&#8217;  All of that leads to problems with&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Innovation System </h2>



<p>The innovation system in <em>CKIII</em> takes the place of the normal &#8216;tech tree,&#8217; and while I am going to lay into some of its issues here in a moment, I do think that the <em>framing</em> here is good.  &#8216;Innovation,&#8217; is a good, broad term for the complex of ideas, technologies and social structures represented here (all of which have good names for sending players on profitable wiki-walks).  It&#8217;s also a more fun and interesting system than <em>CKII</em>&#8216;s technology-levels, since each innovation is unique rather than simply iterating a bonus to a slightly higher level.</p>



<p>I won&#8217;t bury the lede here though: <strong>the main problem is that innovations are gated by era, with each era&#8217;s innovations locked behind a minimum year</strong>.  That has all sorts of knock-on-effects, the most obvious is the duct-tape solution of giving Byzantium primogeniture at game start because otherwise they couldn&#8217;t develop it until <em>1200</em>.  But more broadly it shows up in the problem of major cities (Constantinople, but also Baghdad and Cordoba) starting at the development cap with limited ability to expand for decades.  Inexplicably the Byzantines start the game having forgotten how to <em>found cities</em>, presumably because &#8211; since they have several decades to wait until the second tier of the tech tree unlocks &#8211; they needed <em>something</em> to research.  Likewise, the early English kingdoms in this system have to start out with minimal centralization and confederate partition with no real ability to much change either for decades or centuries, despite the fact that Alfred the Great (r. 848-899) and his successors seem to have built a remarkably centralized kingdom which wasn&#8217;t subject to further fragmentation.</p>

As you can see, none of the high medieval innovations are available, because the year is not 1050.  This would be true even if the second condition (discovering 50% of the early medieval innovations) was met.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In short, the innovation system cannot handle differential development across the broader Mediterranean well at all, gating some societies out of innovations they fairly clearly <em>had</em> for <em>centuries</em> after they fairly clearly had them.  <strong>Moreover, the &#8216;eras&#8217; system imposes a degree of teleological determinism here where knowledge <em>must</em> proceed from fragmenting, decentralized, deurbanized polities towards more coherent, centralized and urbanized ones, but the actual routes that historical polities took through this period were hardly so clear-cut</strong>.  It is a system that works OK for what were clearly the initial focuses of game development &#8211; mostly France, Germany and Scandinavia &#8211; but falls apart outside of that frame fairly quickly and cannot handle exceptions even within it.  <strong>There were areas of honest technological <em>advance</em> in the Middle Ages, but a lot of what ends up in the innovation trees is <em>cultural development</em>, which is hardly so sequential and chronologically rooted as the innovation system implies</strong>.</p>



<p>Now if I may engage in a bit of amateur game design, the clear purpose of the era-gating is to prevent players from &#8216;blitzing&#8217; a handful of powerful late-game innovations early in cultures that historically took centuries for them to develop; primogeniture is the obvious candidate for this kind of &#8216;tech rush.&#8217;  But I suspect as the game&#8217;s focus expands with flavor packs, the limitations of this system are going to become more and more apparent, because the sequences here simply don&#8217;t make a lot of sense.  And I also think just having entirely different tech trees for different cultures is not much of a solution either.</p>



<p>My own amateur &#8216;fix&#8217; would be to ditch the year-gating entirely and instead organize innovations the way dynasty legacies are organized &#8211; a series of parallel sequences where unlocking each level makes the next available (so a sequential tree).  Thus a culture still needs to discover the different succession options in sequence, and needs to figure out how to manage provinces of 25 maximum development before learning how to do so for provinces of 35 development and so on.  Then, to prevent (or at least discourage) players from &#8216;tech rushing&#8217; key technologies, impose a &#8216;cool down&#8217; of several decades between innovations in the same &#8216;tree.&#8217;  That could be a hard gateway, &#8220;you just discovered &#8216;hereditary rule&#8217; and so must wait 50 years to begin &#8216;heraldry'&#8221; or a soft penalty to consecutive innovations in a single category akin to <em>Heart of Iron IV</em>&#8216;s ahead-of-time research penalty.</p>



<p><strong>Reshaping the system that way would, I think, allow for a better expression of the structures and innovations that some cultures had at the beginning of this period</strong>.  The design could then also increase innovation development time based on either the number of innovations known or the highest level innovation known, creating a system whereby the less urbanized and centralized polities could &#8216;catch up&#8217; over time.  Constructing innovations as a tree rather than as a time-gated progression also allows for innovations which represent <em>choices</em>, rather than <em>advances</em>, which brings me to my next topic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Army Structure</h2>



<p>On the one hand, one of the strengths of the <em>Crusader Kings</em> series is that it accurately reflects vassalage-system armies as consisting of a &#8216;<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/">retinue of retinues</a>,&#8217; where each aristocratic vassal brings their own retinue and their vassals who in turn bring their retinues and so on until the army is formed.  That leads to a fairly distinctive (and sometimes ungainly) army structure which <em>CKIII</em> broadly respects.  The units that make up an army in <em>CKIII</em> are each of the levy contributions from either an individual holding or vassal; these can&#8217;t be split up, forcing the player to work with occasionally awkward sized units as a consequence of the system.</p>



<p>In addition to those levy units, a ruler also raises their men-at-arms and knights.  The former reflect standing or semi-professional warriors, which covers a range of different kinds of full-time combatants on the battlefield.  A unit of professional standing infantry fits under this rubric, as would a whole bunch of knights bachelor (unlanded knights) serving in the household or retinue of the king.  The &#8216;knights&#8217; (the term for these fellows is culture dependent) reflect aristocratic courtiers or vassals in the army and the way they function act more like officers than combatants in their own right &#8211; they can have a <em>lot</em> of combat power.  I like the inclusion of &#8216;knights&#8217; &#8211; the concern here is, I think, to try to reflect the personalistic nature of these armies without putting so many named characters in them that the player loses all track of them.  Finally, a ruler can raise mercenaries, which act almost like a &#8216;bonus&#8217; men-at-arms units.</p>

Below you can see I have also hired a number of mercenary companies.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As a <em>foundation</em>, this is a good system, but it tends to flatten a lot of the variety in military structure between different cultures in this period</strong>.  In practice, the system fits best post-Carolingian Latin Christendom (again, understandable given the focus of the game); some cultures, like the Byzantine Greeks above, have small bonuses to tweak the system to better represent their armies (Byzantine characters have larger men-at-arms units and smaller levies, reflecting a more professional army), but a lot of other distinctive and important differences are lost.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already noted, for instance, that the system cannot really simulate either the causes or the effects of the steady drift towards the heavy use of Mamluks in the Abbasid Caliphate and beyond.  The game makes no distinction, after all, between how men-at-arms units are raised, but the political ramifications of the use of enslaved Turkish soldiers in the Islamic world were substantial.  On the flipside, just as I&#8217;ve noted that <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s vision of &#8216;feudalism&#8217; is an odd fit for pre-1066 England, so too is its military system.  The early English <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/">fyrd-system</a> was substantially more centralized (there&#8217;s a reason William the Conqueror had the administrative apparatus post-1066 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book">to do a comprehensive survey</a> of the <em>entire kingdom</em>; that apparatus had been built up for the fyrd military system), aiming to produce big armies of mobilized freeholding farmers (forms around the royal household&#8217;s heavy infantry, the <em>huscarls</em>) rather than armies of knights with their retinues.  Meanwhile, what I know of the military systems of medieval India, built around the &#8216;three arms&#8217; of foot, horse and chariot with a substantially disarmed peasant farmer class providing taxes rather than levies, doesn&#8217;t fit this model well either.</p>



<p>That said, if I may once again put on my amateur designer hat, I think the levies-men-at-arms-knights model is flexible enough to accommodate these differing systems.  My own instinct would be to add &#8216;army structure&#8217; as either a realm law (parallel to crown authority) or a cultural tradition (I&#8217;d lean towards the former).  I might offer the following systems as choices (with proposed bonuses to reflect their nature):</p>



<ul>
<li>Fyrd System: Higher levy contribution from vassals to make a levy-centered army.</li>



<li>Steppe System: Substantially lower total levies, but levies from steppe-nomad-culture vassals are horse archers, with a bonus that at last it wouldn&#8217;t be necessary to give the Mongols a huge number of &#8216;event&#8217; troops to make them dangerous.</li>



<li>Professional Core (e.g. the ERE before c. 1000 or so): Essentially the current traditions bonus for the Byzantines, with fewer levies but more men-at-arms.  This might work in degrees, from &#8216;professional core&#8217; to an almost fully professional army (the latter perhaps reflecting the disarmed peasantry of parts of India, for instance).</li>



<li>Mercenary Core (e.g. the Komnenoi, Abbasids): Permanent mercenary companies begin to take the place of levies, but their leaders are powerful and dangerous vassals.</li>



<li>Feudal Array: The current system.  To balance it, perhaps the liege when raising a vassal&#8217;s levies also raises a proportion of their knights &#8211; perhaps a proportion based on vassal opinion &#8211; which might better reflect the centrality of military elites to this system as compared to the older fyrd-style systems.</li>
</ul>



<p>Access to a given system could then be put into the innovation system, with different cultures starting having &#8216;discovered&#8217; one or the other system, but being able to &#8216;discover&#8217; and adopt another culture&#8217;s military system.  <strong>As the system stands now, essentially everyone deploys what is effectively a feudal array, which rather flattens a lot of the variety in military systems we actually see in the period</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Peasants and Burghers</h2>



<p>All of which gets my small issues out of the way and leads into my larger issue with <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s design.  As we discussed at the beginning of the series, I prefer to break what we sometimes call &#8216;feudalism&#8217; into two distinct systems: vassalage (the system for political-military relationships between elites) and manoralism (the system for economic relationships between the peasantry and elites).  And almost everything we&#8217;ve discussed has been about vassalage: how it functions, how personalistic it is as a system, how legitimacy is built within a vassalage-based polity and so on.</p>



<p>We have spent almost no time, however, on manorialism and the commons, which is fitting because frankly <em>CKIII</em> doesn&#8217;t spend much time on them either.  It is hard to say this is necessarily a <em>failing</em> so much as it is a clear <em>choice</em>.  As I noted with <em>EUIV</em> and <em>Victoria II</em>, each Paradox game chooses a focus: <em>EUIV</em> is about states and not people, whereas <em>Victoria II</em> is much more about people (and tries not to be about war).  In its design, the clear decision was made to make <em>CKIII</em> about elites and not peasants; the former are lovingly modeled with even barons and landless elite courtiers given personalities and making AI-based decisions.  That focus clearly comes at the expense of the peasantry.</p>

<p>In as much as the peasantry is represented, it is as a part of their holding.  Each holding has a &#8216;development&#8217; score which reflects the level of urbanization and population present,<span id='easy-footnote-2-15670' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15670' title='The tooltip says it reflects &amp;#8220;the local infrastructure and technological advancement in a County,&amp;#8221; but given its effects, this really ought to be population and urbanism.'><sup>2</sup></a></span> which increases the levies and taxes the holding grants as well as the size of army that can be present without experiencing supply loss (essentially a &#8216;<a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/07/29/collections-logistics-how-did-they-do-it-part-ii-foraging/" data-type="post" data-id="14164">foraging cap</a>&#8216;).  The effectiveness and pervasiveness of your administration is reflected by the &#8216;Control&#8217; score (out of 100), with low control often leading to penalties to levies and taxes.  Levies and taxes are further modified by buildings you can construct in the holding in four &#8216;slots.&#8217;</p>



<p>Finally, the attitude of the peasantry to you is reflected by a &#8216;popular opinion&#8217; score.  This is a very simple mechanic, with generally fairly few modifiers, with the largest being if the ruler is the same faith and culture as the county and a stacking penalty for waging offensive wars.  It provides no bonuses if positive, but if deeply negative popular uprising factions may form, which are generally far less dangerous than vassal factions (which makes some sense; peasant revolts were both fairly common and mostly failed).  A number of in-game events offer dilemmas which can increase or decrease popular opinion, though frequent offensive warfare is the most common cause of highly negative popular opinion.  In a sense then popular opinion is the other half of the vassal opinion legitimacy framework reflecting the peasantry&#8217;s view of the regime&#8217;s legitimacy, but in practice this mechanic is decidedly secondary.</p>



<p>The burghers &#8211; the residents of towns &#8211; get a bit more focus, but only a bit.  Town governments are represented by baron-level vassals (&#8216;mayors&#8217;), but as characters in the governing system these fellows are mostly inert.  They don&#8217;t scheme to expand the town&#8217;s influence and pay a fixed percentage of their taxes and levies regardless of opinion.</p>



<p>The player in turn has relatively little to do with the burghers or the peasants.  While historical recruitment systems often reached pretty deeply into the organization of the countryside, doing things like brigading households together with each group of households required to provide recruits, or setting land aside for military settlers, the player isn&#8217;t involved in any of that, nor do they engage in tax collection or reform.  These roles aren&#8217;t <em>absent</em>, but they&#8217;re abstracted into tasks the player can set their councilors on (stewards can collect taxes or increase development, marshals can increase control or levies) whose effects are directly proportional to their relevant skills; a set-it-and-forget-it mechanic.  This, combined with some events, at least acknowledges that this would have been a daily concern of the ruler &#8211; the management of his own lands &#8211; but abstracts it away so the player can focus on other things.  <strong>On the balance, I think this is an understandable design decision, but the player looking to think historically needs to be aware just how much is being abstracted away here.</strong></p>



<p>For a game focused on rulership though, the inertness of town governments strikes me as more of a problem.  Major towns could be <em>very</em> troublesome vassals.  In game, towns are represented as having minimal defensive capabilities, but in actual practice a<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/12/10/collections-fortification-part-iii-castling/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/12/10/collections-fortification-part-iii-castling/"> fortified town full of angry burghers</a> was a very difficult military problem, since a large and motivated town militia could dispose of a lot of labor in its defense.  At the same time, because burghers tended to be wealthier than peasants, town militias were a good source of higher quality infantry (both armored infantrymen but also crossbowmen), making good relations with them important for developing military force.  A lord could dictate to the peasants, but had to <em>negotiate</em> with major towns, and this just isn&#8217;t well reflected in-game.</p>



<p>One of the issues is the structure of holdings: each county is split more or less evenly into castle, temple and town holdings (typically one of each, plus perhaps an open slot or two) and these holdings are more or less equally productive (castles produce more levies, towns more taxes, temples somewhere in the middle).  But in practice a big town &#8211; which is going to come with its own surrounding agricultural hinterland &#8211; could be a substantial nucleus of population and wealth that would have made it substantially <em>more</em> important than surrounding castles or monasteries.  <strong>Not all towns were like this, but certainly larger towns could be outsized and powerful vassals in a way that simply doesn&#8217;t happen in <em>CKIII</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In my view this reflects one of the major weaknesses of <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s design.</strong>  I suspect the developers are aware of this too; quite a number of events added with <em>Royal Court</em> relate to the concerns of the burghers or the peasantry so there is an apparent desire to represent this, but it isn&#8217;t well integrated into the game&#8217;s systems.  Whereas I can imagine DLC or flavor-pack sized &#8216;fixes&#8217; for the game&#8217;s struggles in these other issues (states, the Byzantines, etc.) it&#8217;s hard to see how <em>CKIII</em> could do much more than just those events without a fairly radical redesign.  That said, I understand this as a design concession; games like this have to focus on <em>something</em> and some of Paradox&#8217;s other titles (<em>Victoria </em>and <em>Imperator</em> especially) are much more common-people-oriented.  <strong>As I&#8217;ve noted before, one of the great strengths of the Paradox oeuvre is that because each game focuses on different aspects of history, they can serve as correctives and rebuttals to each other</strong>, though it is a shame that by far the most people-oriented game in the catalog, <em>Victoria</em>, has also traditionally been the most niche of the set.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reading <em>Crusader Kings</em></h2>



<p>For all of these complaints though, I think <em>Crusader Kings</em> <em>III</em> is probably more successful at achieving a historically informative simulation as compared to <em>EUIV</em> and <em>Victoria II</em> (though neither of those games is a failure by any means).  My own sense, witnessing also the way that their other titles, especially <em>EUIV</em>, have evolved over time is that this is reflective of the growing maturity in Paradox&#8217;s historical design, but also the smaller geographic scope (though even here <em>CKIII</em> suffers from placing South and Central Asia in soft focus).  It isn&#8217;t perfect, mind you &#8211; indeed I&#8217;ve just spent the last 5,000 or so words complaining about it and this is hardly a complete bill of goods.  <strong>The core of both the success and the omissions of <em>Crusader Kings III</em>&#8216;s vision of the Middle Ages is its focus on fragmented polities governed through dynastic, personalistic rule</strong>; within that framework the game is a remarkably capable simulator of vassalage politics (within the bounds of what is possible for a mainstream video game), <strong>but historical elements outside of those bounds are at best gestured at in events</strong>, <strong>when they aren&#8217;t</strong> <strong>simply omitted.</strong></p>



<p><strong>For the teacher</strong> then, looking at how to respond to students whose vision of the Middle Ages was substantially formed by <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s theory of history focused around dynastic politics<strong> and for the student </strong>looking to expand their knowledge from that base, <strong>the exercise will mostly be one in filling gaps, addressing key historical themes that sit outside of that focus</strong>.  That can mean a focus on the sort of polities that do not fit well within <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s simulation, like the Byzantine Empire or town governments (both those within larger kingdoms but also the independent Italian civic polities like Venice, Genoa and so on), but it can also mean a focus on the sort of <em>people</em> that <em>CKIII</em> leaves out of focus, which mostly means the peasantry, but also to a meaningful extent the clergy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the study of the Middle Ages is fairly well equipped with <em>Annales</em>-inspired micro-histories exploring the lives and <em><em>mentalités</em></em> of the peasantry, works like E.L.R. Ladurie&#8217;s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3g3SBQW" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3g3SBQW">Les Paysans de Languedoc</a></em> (1966; available in trans. J. Day, 1976 as<a href="https://amzn.to/3sblNbL" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3sblNbL"> <em>The Peasants of Languedoc</em></a>) or, reaching just into the early modern period, Carlo Gunzburg&#8217;s <em>Il formaggio e i vermi</em> (1976, <a href="https://amzn.to/3T2GK4g" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3T2GK4g">available in trans. Tadeschi and Tadeschi </a>(1980), the former exploring the material reality of the common peasantry and the latter their cosmology and worldview.</p>



<p><strong>Likewise, it might be worth putting a bit more into exploring the situation within the towns</strong>.  My own knowledge of medieval Italian communal structures is sadly fairly thin beyond the basics (I&#8217;m actually hoping at some point to rope a colleague into guest-blogging about them), so I shall stick more to the rest of Europe.  S. Ogilvie&#8217;s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3CzkmIV" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3CzkmIV">The European Guilds: An Economic Analysis</a></em> (2019) is both a remarkably summary of scholarship on the topic and a tremendous wealth of data and analysis of what we know about how guilds shaped the structure of civic politics and also how they interacted with both city government and larger political structures.  In a narrower study, L. Crombie&#8217;s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3CVz5PA" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3CVz5PA">Archery and Crossbow Guilds in Medieval Flanders</a> </em>(2016) provides a good &#8216;glue&#8217; between the lords-and-vassals centric vision of <em>CKIII</em> and the social structures of towns, as well as illustrating the importance of that relationship since these guilds were both important civic institutions but also key means for lords (in this case the Dukes of Burgundy) to obtain effective infantry from the towns in their realms.  Of course variation by region, time and relationship is substantial; <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3CX2oS1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3CX2oS1">City and Spectacle in Medieval Europe</a> </em>(1994), edited by B.A. Hanawalt and K. L. Reyerson collects a dozen smaller studies of individual interactions (rituals, festivals, donations, etc.) between &#8216;feudal&#8217; rulers and the towns in their domain which gives a sense of the variety and particularity these relationships could have.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>while <em>CKIII</em> can and does gesture at the literature and intellectual culture of the period</strong>, with the player able to commission literary works and retain scholars that fairly clearly call to historical exemplars,<strong> by necessity it only alludes to the content of those works</strong>.<span id='easy-footnote-3-15670' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15670' title='As much as the historian in me might wish for extensive quotations, that wouldn&amp;#8217;t fit with the need for modularity in &lt;em&gt;CKIII&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s event dialogue system and moreover would clash with the series&amp;#8217; general tongue-in-cheek tone.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>  Thus the player is never going to meet St. Benedict, Gregory of Tours, Ibn al-Athir, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/03/27/a-trip-through-dhuoda-of-uzes-carolingian-values/" data-type="post" data-id="2736">Dhuoda of Uzes</a>, Peter Abelard, Heloise d&#8217;Argenteuil, the Venerable Bede, ibn Khaldun, Anna Komnene and so on, or their writings.  Fortunately, every medieval history course I&#8217;ve ever seen already foregrounds intellectual and literary history in this way; myself I make heavy use of the venerable Rosenwein reader (B. Rosenwein, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3SYbfZh" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3SYbfZh">Reading the Middle Ages</a></em> (2006, but now in a third edition), <em><strong>easily</strong></em> one of the best source readers I have ever taught with) to introduce students to the literary culture of the Middle Ages.  For those looking to self-teach, it should be noted that the reader is intended to sync up with Barbara Rosenwein&#8217;s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3CVlFmN" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3CVlFmN">A Short History of the Middle Ages</a></em> (now in a fifth edition), which is also a very capable textbook.<span id='easy-footnote-4-15670' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15670' title='With the noted benefit that Rosenwein also adopts a broadly Mediterranean framework, rather than a strictly western European one.'><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>On the other hand, for the medieval enthusiast for whom <em>CKIII</em> has inspired a desire to look more deeply into the business of rulership and the intellectual framework around medieval kingship, it is hard to recommend a single volume on the topic.  While <em>CKIII</em> models many of the common elements of kingship fairly well, in practice when one wants more specificity kingship generally rapidly becomes the study of particular models of kingship and royal administration that are specific to their time and place.  The next step is thus to pick a polity or dynasty and go reading, though the books written at this level are intended for scholars and written with that in mind.  Nevertheless some tentative suggestions: J.E.A. Jolliffee, <em>Angevin Kingship</em> (1955),<span id='easy-footnote-5-15670' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-15670' title='A warning here: Jolliffee does not translate any of the Latin in the book, so if you cannot read Latin this is going to be a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;difficult book to read as Latin phrases are sprinkled liberally through the text.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>, H. Takayama, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3MyiQuX" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3MyiQuX">The Administration of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily</a></em> (1993), J. Naus, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3T708gI" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3T708gI">Constructing Kingship: The Capetian Monarchs of France and the Early Crusades</a></em> (2016), and L.E. Wangerin, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3rSWOJX" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3rSWOJX">Kingship and Justice in the Ottonian Empire</a> </em>(2019).  There&#8217;s also a fair amount of kingship scholarship discussed and cited comparatively in T.R. Trautmann, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3T1HNRR" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3T1HNRR">Elephants and Kings</a> </em>(2015), stretching into Southeast Asia, though its primary interests as elsewhere.  As you might imagine from books written for scholars, there&#8217;s quite a range here in prices and availability.<span id='easy-footnote-6-15670' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-15670' title='Special thanks here to colleagues Daniel Morgan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PetreRaleigh&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://twitter.com/PetreRaleigh&quot;&gt;Peter Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.tamusa.edu/course-information/Profile/Faculty/379?=Elizabeth-Hasseler&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://apps.tamusa.edu/course-information/Profile/Faculty/379?=Elizabeth-Hasseler&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Hasseler&lt;/a&gt; who helped me in assembling this further reading list.'><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>All of which is a long-winded way of saying that there is more to this period &#8211; indeed any period &#8211; than any single game can cover.  Even more than the other Paradox games we&#8217;ve discussed so far, <em>CKIII</em> picks its focus and sticks to it: this is a game about individual elites and the decisions they make as rulers, and the way that expectations and norms of rulership shape those decisions.  A lot of the missing elements above frankly wouldn&#8217;t fit well into a strategy game of this sort in any case; unlike with <em>Victoria II</em>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/08/13/collections-teaching-paradox-victoria-ii-part-i-mechanics-and-gears/" data-type="post" data-id="8567">where the lives of regular folk could be presented through the processes of industrialization and political liberalization in the period</a>, reflecting the relatively <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/" data-type="post" data-id="3822"><em>unchanging</em> structures</a> of peasant life in the Middle Ages isn&#8217;t a great fit for this kind of game.  Personally, I would love to see a developer really tackle medieval peasant life (in a game where &#8216;peasant village&#8217; isn&#8217;t just a transition stage to &#8216;big city&#8217; &#8211; I&#8217;m actually quite impressed by <em>Farthest Frontier</em>, but you don&#8217;t <em>stay</em> a village in that game) either as an economics/business sim (run the farm, try not to starve, maybe accomplish some upward social mobility) or a narrative driven RPG.  Different genres offer different opportunities.</p>



<p>Next week we&#8217;re going to trade in our spurs for wings to discuss the theory and practice of strategic airpower.  This is a topic that has recently become a frequent request owing to current events, so that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going next.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is the third part of a four part series (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/16/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-i-making-it-personal/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/23/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iia-rascally-vassals/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/">IIb</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/">IV</a>) examining the historical assumptions behind the popular medieval grand strategy game <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, made by Paradox Interactive.  In the last part (in two sections), we discussed how <em>CKIII</em> attempts to model decentralized political power in the fragmented polities of the medieval Mediterranean, with different mechanics to reflect the pressures that led to fragmentation both in the post-Carolingian West and the post-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate">Rashidun </a>East.</p>



<p>This week, we&#8217;re going to look at how <em>CKIII</em> understands power to be wielded and maintained within the system of fragmented, personalistic rule we&#8217;ve established in the previous weeks.  In a sense this is the third leg of a the three-legged stool that is <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s understanding of power in a medieval polity: if power is personal, rather than institutional (leg one) and highly fragmented between many people (leg two), then how is power gained <em>and kept</em> within such systems.  <strong>As historians, we tend to approach this question through the concept of <em>legitimacy</em>, the degree to which a ruling authority (in this case a person) is perceived to be the rightful authority and thus obeyed not out of the fear of force but out of tradition and social pressure</strong>.  Legitimacy, for reasons we&#8217;ll get into, is the fundamental lifeblood of any ruling authority.</p>



<p>Legitimacy in traditional monarchies &#8211; of the sort the player is running in this game &#8211; are in turn founded on <strong>social norms</strong>, collective standards of behavior (often unwritten).  In this case, we&#8217;re interested specifically in the social norms <em>about kingship</em>, since norms often differ based on one&#8217;s position in society (age, sex, social rank, etc.).  There is a degree of circularity here: subjects want their king to act like a &#8216;good king&#8217; and so they are more ready to support a king that acts out (or <em>performs</em>) their understanding of what a good king looks like, which in turn confers legitimacy on the monarchy, which in turn defines for subsequent kings what being a good king looks like.</p>



<p>What is fascinating about <em>CKIII</em> is that one could easily argue that legitimacy is the central theme of the game, that most of the player&#8217;s efforts <em>within</em> a realm are focused on building their own legitimacy or undermining the legitimacy of others and yet &#8216;legitimacy&#8217; is not a a single system or currency within the game.  No character has a &#8216;legitimacy&#8217; score, instead what <em>CKIII</em> has to say about systems of generating legitimacy emerges from its systems, especially modifiers which interact with either vassal opinion.  So that is where we will start: how <em>do </em>you keep all of those scheming vassals happy?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Factions and Kingdoms</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the game systems which influence vassals and holdings, we need to understand what makes vassals compliant and stable in the game.  Vassals have three main ways they can work against their liege: they can scheme (using intrigue to launch hostile schemes), they can withhold levies in some government forms and they can form factions.  Of these factions are generally the most dangerous and the most common way for a liege to lose control over their polity (either by actively being dethroned or by having key decisions taken against their will).</p>



<p>Of these systems, <em><strong>factions</strong></em> are the most immediately relevant.  Factions are coalitions of power centers within a realm which pool together their military power in order to make a demand of their liege, threatening civil war if refused.  These in turn divide into two groups, vassal factions and popular factions; we&#8217;ll deal with the latter later and focus on vassal factions for now.  There are currently four types of vassal factions.  Vassals can demand either that crown authority is lowered, that a different claimant be enthroned as liege, that they alone be made independent <em>or</em> that the kingdom itself be dissolved making <em>everyone</em> independent.</p>

The red dotted line is the mark where a faction will consider itself powerful enough to begin preparing to send an ultimatum, which will happen when the discontent percentage fills.  In this case, my ruler has only been ruler for about 4 years and thus still has the &#8216;short reign&#8217; negative modifier, reflecting the instability around new monarchs, so this is a fairly stable situation, though some attention to the independence faction (mostly North African rulers looking to break away) must be paid, in this case probably by courting the good opinion of some of the key members.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A faction&#8217;s power is computed as a comparison of the military forces available to the liege (both your own holding&#8217;s armies and also the liege&#8217;s slice of the levies of every <em>non-</em>faction member) as compared to the military forces available to the faction (the full army of each participating faction member), so that a vassal who joins a faction both subtracts their contribution from their liege&#8217;s power and adds their <em>entire</em> army to the faction&#8217;s power.  Factions under 80% of the liege&#8217;s power are effectively inert; factions with <em>more</em> than 80% of the liege&#8217;s power gain &#8216;discontent&#8217; rapidly and when this reaches 100%, the faction will deliver an ultimatum; if refused they will rebel, triggering a civil war.  <strong>Vassal contributions to their liege are generally fairly small</strong> (typically around c. 25%), <strong>meaning that it generally takes only a sizable minority of vassals to be in a faction before they have sufficient strength to make demands</strong>.</p>



<p>And in case it isn&#8217;t clear, civil wars resulting from vassal factions are <em>very bad</em>.  For one, the way the discontent threshold works, factions will only make demands if they have a good chance of winning.  It <em>is</em> possible to trigger vassal factions early by unjustly imprisoning a faction member, but the knock-on-effects of the sudden burst of &#8216;tyranny&#8217; modifiers can easy leave a ruler who does that with bigger problems.  At the same time, of course a civil war means a situation in which the kingdom&#8217;s military strength is cannibalizing <em>itself</em>, which can leave the kingdom extremely vulnerable to external powers, while all of the fighting and besieging can cause medium-term economic problems through the &#8216;control&#8217; mechanic (which we&#8217;ll come back to in a moment).</p>



<p><strong>Needless to say, as a liege, the player wants their vassals kept out of factions.</strong>  There are a few &#8216;strong&#8217; bars to vassals joining factions (that is they absolutely prohibit it rather than discouraging it): vassals cannot join a faction against their liege if they are their friend, lover or military ally, if the liege has a &#8216;strong hook&#8217; on them (that is, they owe him a big factor or he has big blackmail on them, that kind of thing), or if they have at least 80 positive opinion of the liege (we&#8217;ll cover opinion more in a moment).  Vassals that are <em>afraid</em> of the liege (a product of &#8216;dread&#8217;) cannot join a faction <em>unless it is over the 80% threshold to generate discontent</em>; which makes dread a useful but dangerous tool that is entirely effective until you desperately need it at which point it is entirely ineffective.</p>



<p>For a small realm with just a handful of vassals, controlling factions through personal relationships (friend, lover, ally) is possible.  Alliances, as noted previously, require a close family connection (siblings, parents, or -in-law versions of the same), so the number of available allies is likely to be <em>fairly</em> limited, though a canny ruler is going to use strategic marriages to &#8216;lock in&#8217; key vassals.  Nevertheless, the larger the realm gets the less these strategies matter: with ten vassals, being besties with two and father-in-law to another two makes the realm stable; in a realm with fifty vassals, that&#8217;s a rounding error on faction formation.</p>

Five are barred because they are underage, one is a friend and the other five are allies through relation (two brothers) or marriage ties (the rest).  That&#8217;s eleven total vassals &#8216;neutralized&#8217; this way, in a realm where the Caliph has <strong>sixty-two</strong> direct vassals.  Eleven is <strong>good</strong>, but it is not <strong>enough</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Which leaves opinion </strong>(and dread)<strong> as a key tool in controlling vassals</strong>: <strong>by and large the player wants their vassals to have a positive opinion of them</strong>, even if (as feudal or tribal vassals), their opinion does not effect their troop contributions.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15532' title='Opinion &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; matters for lots of intrigue and since members of your council &amp;#8211; typically powerful vassals &amp;#8211; are potentially agents in schemes against you, having them &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; you is an important way to plug gaps in your &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; security.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>  High opinion discourages hostile anti-liege scheming and faction formation, the latter in a sliding scale up to that positive-80 opinion where vassals <em>cannot</em> join a faction against you.  Of course the reverse is true for negative opinion (character opinion ranges from +100 to -100): characters with massively negative opinion of their liege are almost guaranteed to form or join factions.  For rulers with clan-type vassals whose taxes and levies vary based on opinion, the relationship between opinion and realm stability is intensified since this creates a sliding scale rather than a binary in terms of vassal contribution to realm stability (not in faction and supplying troops) or instability (in faction, supply troops to that faction).  And finally, vassals with high opinion tend to have events and interactions with you (like swearing fealty, giving gifts, inviting you to feasts, etc.) which are beneficial, whereas vassals that hate your guts will do things like try to assassinate you.</p>



<p>Fundamentally then, the stability of a kingdom is substantially dependent on the liege keeping positive opinion (as much as possible) of their vassals while also potentially maintaining <em>some</em> dread (to scare the malcontents).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Brief Aside on Realm Structure</h2>



<p>As a brief aside before we move on &#8211; the above statement is key for what comes next but is not the end of large-realm-maintenance strategy.  I tend to most enjoy being the liege of fairly large realms, so this is a part of the game that gets a lot of my attention.  The player as a king or emperor can improve their margin of error with factions also by building up the royal demesne &#8211; their personal holdings &#8211; to maximize revenue and levy generation, since you get 100% <em>of your own levies</em> in a civil war.  In essence you then are reinvesting the taxes on your vassals to build up your ability to leverage your personal army against them (this is why, as you can see in my screenshots, I take so much care to avoid fragmenting my &#8216;core&#8217; royal holdings even with partition &#8211; those are the most heavily improved counties in the kingdom and thus give my ruler a lot of power to play with).  In addition, the player wants to avoid the emergence of jumbo-vassals with vast territory, because those fellows if they get out of control can easily become the core of a dangerous faction.</p>



<p>The ideal stable kingdom then would be each duke with only one duchy, holding only the capital county of that duchy personally, with a single count on every other county, perfectly mapping the <em>de jure</em> boundaries.  The <em>limit</em> to that strategy is that it reduces the kingdom&#8217;s effective offensive power: by adding the <em>maximum</em> number of vassal layers between the king and the lowest rulers (the barons), a lot of military potential ends up trapped locally.  Let&#8217;s assume a duchy with 5 counties, each county has 3 holdings and each holding generates 100 levies; so the whole thing has 1,500 levies.  If the duke holds all five county titles directly, he has 500 personal levies and his barons (all direct vassals) have 1,000 of which he gets a quarter (250), so he has 750 total levies which means <em>you</em> (the king) get 187 men from him in war time.  <em>But</em> if his duchy is fragmented as intended here he has just 100 personal levies, plus 6 direct vassals (4 counts, 2 barons); each baron gives him 25 men, each count 37 (they have 100 personal, plus 50 indirect from their two barons), so his total is just 300 levy troops (100+(2*25)+(4*37.5)), of which you the king only get 75 in war time.  But at the same time, that means should that duke join a faction, he only removes 75 levies from the king&#8217;s strength and adds only 300 to the faction&#8217;s strength, which is a lot less dangerous than 187 and 750 respectively.  This becomes substantially more important once a realm is large enough to require vassal <em>kings</em> to stay under the vassal limit (a factor for those looking to rebuild the Roman Empire, for instance).</p>

The largest yellow Isbaniya chunk is the royal realm, which as you can see is quite large (and also well developed); my own personal territory (including baron-tier vassals) provides around 12,000 troops (including men-at-arms), substantially more than any vassal (indeed, more than my top four vassals combined) which helps to make the realm resilient against factions.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In my own experience, the benefits to realm stability in breaking up (when you can do so without tyranny) vassals who have begun &#8216;consolidating&#8217; their own <em>de jure</em> areas (that is, their duchies) generally outweigh the lost military power for most large realms if the player has also been diligent in building up the main royal core, because that royal core (and the mercenaries and men-at-arms units it supports) will provide the necessary military core.  At the same time, as crown authority increases, the problem implied here reduces because each layer&#8217;s contribution of levies and taxes upward increases, which reduces the difference between a duke with a bunch of count vassals and a duke that holds his entire duchy personally.</p>



<p>On the flipside, avoiding &#8216;double dukes&#8217; (or dukes that end up having lots of non-<em>de jure</em> vassals) is a much more clear-cut priority.  A duke that consolidates two whole duchies is likely to be approaching the personal realm holdings of the king or emperor and is thus a substantial threat.  When I run large realms I am generally on the lookout for opportunities to break up such situations, by a variety of means.  If the ruler in question is caught committing a crime, that can be used to break up the titles via revocation, as can enforced partition as part of the feudal contract in realms that have adopted single-heir succession systems.  It can even make sense to take some tyranny to &#8216;clean up&#8217; titles if your ruler is well ensconced on the throne, to make things easier for a future heir who lacks that advantage; my own pet name for this slow-motion &#8216;rolling revocation&#8217; strategy is &#8216;revoke-a-palooza.&#8217;</p>



<p>The reason you, as the player, may need all of these strategies is that while your current ruler may be a charismatic diplomat with great skills and a robust opinion bonus from having a long reign, his heir may be none of these things.  Succession is always the moment of maximum peril for large realms, precisely because a new ruler is weak and succession creates lots of potential claimants for unhappy vassals to rally around.  Building up the &#8216;margin of safety&#8217; thus keeps the realm stable through generations by centralizing power around the monarch.  Of course a player can carry out this kind of state-building to a degree that isn&#8217;t very historical, focusing relentlessly on it over multiple generations.</p>



<p>That digression out of the way, on with the show.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Opinion and Prestige</h2>



<p>In <em>CKIII</em>, every character has an opinion of every other character within their diplomatic range, which represents how much they like or dislike that character, in a range from positive 100 to negative 100.  Opinion calculation is simple: a character&#8217;s opinion of you is simple sum of all of the modifiers.  What is complex is that there are a <em>lot</em> of possible modifiers, but we can group them into just a few &#8216;buckets&#8217; to understand how the game system processes them.  The key thing is <strong>positive opinion modifiers reward the player for acting within the expectations of medieval rulership while breaking with those expectations will generally anger vassals and lower their opinion</strong>.  So let&#8217;s walk through the major categories of opinion modifiers.</p>



<p>First off there are a set of &#8216;relations&#8217; modifiers (friend, soulmate, rival, etc.); generally characters will only have a few of these over their lifetime.  In addition to this there are a bunch of personal modifiers based on actions you have taken: giving someone a gift makes them happy, trying to have them assassinated makes them quite upset.  These individual modifiers matter in the game because all rulership is personal but when we are thinking about <em>realm stability</em> with lots of vassals, it is really the modifiers that impact the most characters that matter the most (though absolutely infuriating a powerful vassal or two can absolutely wreck a kingdom).  <strong>So we&#8217;re going to focus on global modifiers to vassals</strong> (be they vassal specific or general for everyone).</p>



<p>Then there is a ruler&#8217;s personality and skills.  The Diplomacy skill provides a flat bonus or penalty to character opinion, reflecting your ruler&#8217;s ability to actually <em>do</em> the work of court interactions (high diplomacy skill also frequently gives &#8216;outs&#8217; in difficult events to avoid offending people).  On top of this, personality matters; while most characters like characters with the same trait as them and dislike characters with the opposite trait, certain traits are liked or disliked by vassals <em>generally</em>.  Brave, Just, and Patient all give general vassal opinion bonuses, while Craven, Stubborn, Arbitrary, Impatient, Paranoid and Sadistic all give penalties.<span id='easy-footnote-2-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15532' title='Sadistic&amp;#8217;s penalty is actually &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt;, rather than just vassals.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>  The bonuses and penalties of these traits tend to be small, ranging from +5 to -10; they stack but characters generally only have three traits, limiting how high they can be stacked.</p>

While a lot of these are cultural, notice how many are from doing rulership (Court Grandeur, commissioning a history (the Al-Yiliqichronicon), personal diplomacy, illustrious (that&#8217;s the fame bonus), being brave, held a large feast) and how many of the penalties are failures to do rulership (tyranny, holding too many duchy titles, doing too much offensive warfare, being impatient and stubborn).</figcaption></figure>



<p>More pervasive is the<a href="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Resources#Prestige" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Resources#Prestige"> fame modifier</a>, ranging from negative 10 to positive 30 for all secular rulers; every character has a fame level.  The way fame works is that various prestigious actions (holding hunts, having or creating titles, being lauded, winning battles, etc.) give a character prestige and fame in equal amounts; prestige is a resource that is then <em>spent</em> to do things, while fame accumulates.  Fame <em>can</em> be lost, but only rarely so; in practice fame is the sort of lifetime value of all of the prestige your character has earned.  <em><a href="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Dynasty#Renown" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Dynasty#Renown">Splendor</a></em>, a sort of dynasty-wide fame rating, starts characters off at birth with prestige (they benefit from a famous name), so building dynasty splendor is a strategy to give all of your rulers a leg up in terms of holding together a kingdom.</p>



<p>In some ways the inverse of fame&#8217;s effect is <strong>tyranny</strong>, a negative modifier with effectively no limit that a character gains every time they take what are perceived as unjust actions (imprisonment without cause, that sort of thing).  It decays slowly and lowers the opinion of all vassals and all courtiers, which can obviously be <em>quite bad</em> since the former make factions and the latter are effective agents in schemes against you.  Individual tyrannical acts range from -5 to -20 opinion, but they stack so that repeatedly acting tyrannically can compile much larger negative modifiers.  Unlike in previous games where characters remembered specific acts of tyranny, in <em>CKIII</em>, tyranny is more of a general reputation.</p>



<p>Already we can make some observations about how this system functions.  First, vassals care about a ruler&#8217;s character, though not as much as they care about a ruler&#8217;s actions.  A brave, just, patient ruler&#8217;s opinion bonus will be entirely swamped by unjustly imprisoning <em>just one</em> vassal (and they&#8217;ll also pick up a bunch of stress for it, because they&#8217;re just).  At the same time, while vassals react very negatively to sources of tyranny, they aren&#8217;t looking for a &#8216;nice guy&#8217; ruler either.  Instead, they value <em>prestige</em>, and so it is worth looking at how prestige is acquired.</p>



<p>The main sources of passive prestige (and thus fame) are the titles a ruler holds personally, with a percentage bonus from diplomacy skill added on top.<span id='easy-footnote-3-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15532' title='I have tended to avoid giving ranges for skill-bonuses because &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; skills can go all the way to 100, though in practice skills above 20 are &lt;em&gt;exceedingly&lt;/em&gt; rare.  At 20 diplomacy, a character gets +12% monthly prestige.  That&amp;#8217;s a meaningful, but not overwhelming bonus.  It certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t change the balance of what I&amp;#8217;m about to point out.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>  Added to this are prestige bonuses from personal and court artifacts which can add up quickly to a substantial bonus; being the head of a large dynasty is also a major prestige bonus.  But what I want to note is the sort of &#8216;outer edge of the possible&#8217; for this, for which let me introduce you to Emperor Konstantinos VII, ruler of the re-established Roman Empire, Emperor, King (3x), Duke (2x), Count (11x), with a maxxed out court, a diplomacy of 16, both <em>Joyeuse</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>Curtana</em> and effectively infinite wealth:</p>

<p>He has 23.9 monthly prestige, which is a <em>ton</em>.  Needless to say even most independent kings will only have a fraction of this.  But getting to the maximum fame level requires earning 25,000 prestige which at this rate will take 87 years.  Clearly there must be other ways of getting prestige to get those sweet, sweet secular opinion bonuses.  And there are!  Both feasts and hunts can provide prestige, especially if you have a lavish royal court with lots of servants and good food, but those decisions are expensive and can only be fired once every five years.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;ll cut to the chase: successful warfare is the main driver of massive fame.  Declaring war itself requires an investment of either prestige or its religious equivalent, piety (but <em>not</em> fame or its religious equivalent, devotion); you have to spend some political capital to bring all of your vassals to war and this reflects that expenditure.  But most war types also<a href="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Casus_belli" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Casus_belli"> <em>reward prestige</em></a> to the winner of the war, and they tend to reward quite a lot of it.  For instance, it costs 100 prestige to declare a war to recover <em>de jure</em> territory from another ruler<span id='easy-footnote-4-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15532' title='That is, your title or the title of your vassal &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to make you a ruler of a place, but someone else has it, you can declare war to go get it.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>, but if you win you receive the land <em>and</em> 300 prestige (split between all of your allies, but if you attacked alone, you get all of it).  Now that means if successful you &#8216;net&#8217; 200 prestige, <em><strong>but 300 fame</strong></em> (because prestige <em>but not fame</em> were spent declaring war) and now you have the &#8216;seed&#8217; prestige to immediately <em>declare war again</em> (on someone else).  This is why, for instance, when I needed to hit a high fame level in my House al-Yiliqi playthrough, my kingdom embarked on a sudden conquest spree in the Maghreb &#8211; that was the necessary process of building the political capital to do what I wanted.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s actually not even the limit of this.  Battles provide fame or devotion if you win them (sieges reward gold instead), so a war with lots of big battles (that you win) will reward <em>even more</em> fame than just the prestige for winning.  Moreover, big conquests may also mean situations in which ducal or royal titles can be either created or usurped from their old holders (because you now have all of that territory), which rewards another 300 prestige for ducal titles and 400 for kingdom titles.  For comparison again, the passive prestige of ruling 3/4ths of the Roman World was just 23.9 per month, just under 300 per year.  <strong>At almost any stage of the game there is <em>far</em> more prestige to be earned by successful warfare than through any other source</strong>, often an order of magnitude more.  And the high fame bonus is <em>really big</em>; it is a 40-point swing in vassal opinion from no fame to the highest fame.</p>



<p>In short then, the games mechanics drive the player &#8211; even a player who merely wants an internally secure realm &#8211; towards external warfare.  Why?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Constructing Legitimacy</h2>



<p>Which brings us back to international relations theory!  We&#8217;ve already met IR realism, which contends that states pursue their material interests and tries to understand state action through that lens, as well as emotional choice theory which contends that apart from these material concerns, the emotional states and incentives of individual decision-makers matter.  But this sort of game model, which encourages the player to take certain actions (and we&#8217;ll look at actions-not-war in a moment because they fit here too) not necessarily because of the territorial results but because of how they would be <em>perceived</em> by peers and vassals because of the way those choices fit how those peers and vassals understand the role of a ruler, that sits largely outside of these concerns.  Emotional-choice leaders are guided largely by the desire to produce or avoid specific feelings, while IR realist states are essentially amoral actors looking to maximize security and power, considering the opinions of other states only in as much as they might interfere with those goals.  This is something quite different.  Here the monarch&#8217;s actions are guided by <em>cultural expectations</em> and <em>institutional structures</em> (vassalage itself being the key institution here) as much as practical utility.</p>



<p>Which at last brings us to the next big international relations theory field: <em><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(international_relations)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(international_relations)">constructivism</a></strong></em>.  The central idea of constructivist thinking in international relations is to regard decision-making as fundamentally shaped by institutional and cultural factors (which are &#8216;socially constructed&#8217; &#8211; a fancy way of saying &#8216;made by humans&#8217; &#8211; thus the term constructivism).  Rulers and leaders under a constructivist framework do not so much make rational, Machiavellian calculations to maximize strategic benefit as they aim to <em><strong>perform rulership or leadership</strong></em>, in whatever form that takes in their culture: they make decisions within a cultural script provided for them.  That form, in turn, in constructivist thought, is shaped by social and historical factors (which is just a fancy way of saying, &#8216;it comes about culturally over time as a consequence of that culture&#8217;s history&#8217;).</p>

<p>Leaders and rulers, in this framework are thus not so much dune buggies ranging over the wide open desert with an infinite number of choices as they are cars navigating a culturally determined highway system with a limited number of lanes, roads and turns, their choices constricted by the need or desire to &#8216;perform rulership.&#8217;  I should note that while &#8216;perform&#8217; and &#8216;performativity&#8217; are the standard academic language, especially in the humanities, for these kinds of interactions, that does not mean the performance is insincere (the strong implication from the word &#8216;perform&#8217; that the performance is insincere is one of the reasons I find &#8216;performativity&#8217; an unsatisfying framework in which to understand historical actors.  Academics who use the term will <em>insist</em> it does not have this meaning and then go and use it exactly in this way in common speech.  People in the past generally believed their own religion and ideology and were generally invested in the values of their culture!).  Indeed, a ruler growing up within a culture is very likely to have internalized that model of how rulers <em>ought</em> to behave and when decisions come up be guided as much by the idea of &#8216;I want to be a good ruler and good rulers do X&#8217; than &#8216;doing X will convince the people I am a good ruler.&#8217;</p>



<p>In <em>CKIII</em>, this the constructivist vision is expressed in two ways: the game both <em>blocks</em> and <em>nudges</em>. For the blocks, some actions are simply unavailable if they sit well outside a character&#8217;s accepted cultural milieu.  The clearest example of this is the inability to declare unjustified wars (something that<em> can</em> be done in <em>EUIV</em>); though the culturally relevant excuses to go to war differ from one culture to the next and differ based on the target, such an excuse is required.  But most of the impacts are nudges: tyranny penalties for some things, vassal opinion bonuses for others, showing the player the culturally preferred path of rulership, which they can take or deviate from as they wish.</p>



<p>In history, the idea that rulership is strongly shaped by cultural and historic factors in this way is so strongly embedded and pervasive in our approaches that it doesn&#8217;t have its own &#8216;school&#8217; the way that it does in political science and international relations theory.  It does, however, lead to, I&#8217;d argue, two broad approaches to studying what kings do and how they are understood, though of course most historians mix these methods. <strong> The most materialistic approach is what I&#8217;m going to call &#8211; for lack of a more theorized term &#8211; studying &#8216;kinging.&#8217;  </strong>This approach assumes that kings are what they do, that the best way to chart the social assumptions that inform kingship are to chart the actions of kings, the structure of their administrations and so on.  In the ancient world, this approach is very strongly associated with Fergus Millar&#8217;s magisterial <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3fKMgcS" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3fKMgcS">The Emperor in the Roman World</a></em> (1977), but the same method has been employed for the various monarchies of the medieval Mediterranean world.  As we&#8217;ll see, the nature of the many fragmented states of Europe has tended to mean that each polity has to be studied as its own <em>sui generis</em> creature; not one model of medieval kingship but many.</p>

<p>The other approach, <strong>far more common in medieval studies in my experience, is to study king<em>ship</em>, which is to say the ideological and literary constructs that medieval people</strong> <strong>&#8211; mostly authors, most of whom were members of the clergy, but also medieval people more broadly &#8211; built around the institution, as a means of understanding how the institution was understood</strong>.  This is a subset of the <em>Annales</em> school&#8217;s emphasis on <em><em>mentalités</em></em> and it is no shock that it is pervasive in medieval studies, given that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Bloch" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Bloch">Marc Bloch</a>, an enormously influential scholar of medieval Europe, was also one of the most important figures in the development of the <em>Annales</em> school.  <em><em>Mentalités</em></em> here are the ways in which people in the past understood and thought about their world; often, as it turns out, quite differently than we do today.  While the study of <em>mentalités</em> is most often associated with a &#8216;history from below&#8217; approach (also part of the <em>Annales</em> school), the study of kingship is more often a question of what are effectively <strong>elite </strong><em><em>mentalités</em></em>, expressed through writings on kingship.</p>



<p>Fortunately for historians, the literate elite of the Middle Ages wrote a lot about kingship and its place in elite values.  Sometimes they did so explicitly in that frame in the form of &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_for_princes" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_for_princes">mirrors for princes</a>&#8216; &#8211; guides on how to rule well.  But just as often this is taking place in the chronicles and histories they are producing as well.  Scholars of kingship (and indeed, of polity-formation more broadly) will thus point out that the authors writing these chronicles are often engaged not merely in recording events and facts but in constructing (that word again) kingship as an institution an ideological construct as they do so, building a framework for future kings <em>and future vassals </em>to understand their role.  As with research on the mechanics of kingship itself, the programs of literary legitimacy building for kings tend not to fit a single ideological pattern but vary by author, monarch and dynasty.</p>



<p>As an aside, one of the most wonderful things added in DLC so far for me was realizing that you, as a king or emperor, <em>can commission or sponsor such works</em>, exactly as a historical ruler might, encouraging (with money and a spot at court) an author in your kingdom to write about your grand lineage and deeds.  Moreover, once written such a book can be displayed in your court, where it grants prestige and sometimes a small boost to vassal opinion, which is, it seems to me, <em>exactly</em> what the kings who commissioned or encouraged such works thought they were getting out of them (and often, by the by, the circulation of such works was similarly limited; the point wasn&#8217;t that everyone always <em>read</em> them but that the <em>existence</em> of a grand chronicle of your house testified itself to your legitimacy and right to rule).  It immediately put me in mind of works like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesta_Normannorum_Ducum" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesta_Normannorum_Ducum"><em>Gesta Normannorum Ducum</em></a> (written by Guillaume de Jumièges, later expanded and revised by Orderic Vitalis), a laudatory history of the Normans up to (and eventually beyond) the conquest of England which is also engaged in constructing legitimacy for William I and his descendants.  I legitimately giggled for for a few minutes when I saw that you could do this because it is such a medieval-kingship thing to do.<span id='easy-footnote-5-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-15532' title='Though realistically it should also probably give you a malus that makes tyranny accumulate more quickly, since now with a history of your house on offer, vassals can more easily accuse you of breaking with the ancient and customary practice of your ancestors when you revoke all of their titles and imprison them.'><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>



<p><strong>The fundamental idea here is <em>legitimacy</em></strong>; the king cannot rule by force alone and so must convince his most important supporters (those key vassals with their own private armies) that his rule is legitimate.  This kind of &#8216;legitimacy building&#8217; often seems strange to students coming from modern liberal democracies because those modern government forms rely on the deep well of legitimacy inherent in a democratic process (&#8216;our decision&#8217; being more legitimate by nature than &#8216;my decision&#8217;), but such legitimacy-building was and remains a crucial tool for monarchies of all kinds.</p>

Normally doing this would clear out all of the Christian rulers all the way down when we won, but due to Muwalladism&#8217;s &#8216;pluralism&#8217; doctrine, this just vassalizes them, leaving the empire now with a large number of Christian vassals.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The valuable distinction here is between two kinds of methods to get people to do what you want, the dichotomy, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a> presents it in &#8220;On Violence&#8221; (1972), between violence and power.  A king&#8217;s options for direct coercion &#8211; for the use of violence to <em>make</em> other people obey &#8211; was always limited (and reliant on getting the men doing the violence to obey without themselves being violenced against), but it was <em>extremely</em> limited for medieval kings whose key subjects <em>also</em> had armies and castles.  Instead they had to rely on power &#8211; on the ability to coordinate voluntary collective action &#8211; in order to get things done or at least in order to get <em>enough</em> of their armed subordinates on board to coerce the rest.  Legitimacy &#8211; the sense that the king&#8217;s rule is rightful and his orders are, in general, to be obeyed &#8211; is the tool by which that power is supported.</p>



<p>Fundamental to these notions of legitimacy was the idea of the kingship as a customary institution.  As moderns, we are enamored with the idea of progress and change, but by and large pre-modern thinking was that things should continue to be done the way they have always been done, which makes a lot of sense in a world where technological and social change moved quite slowly.  <strong>Kingship fits neatly into this mold: a good king was a king who practiced kingship in the way that kingship had always been practiced, fulfilling traditional models of how kings were supposed to behave and act</strong>.  By doing that, or at least appearing to do that, kings could build the necessary legitimacy, lasting over generations, which enabled them to impel their collective subordinates to action.</p>



<p>In particular, the king&#8217;s traditional roles generally fit under three large headers: chief priest, chief judge, and chief general &#8211; that is the religious, legal and military head of a society.  But the military role is peculiar of the three; the first two roles are judged based on how they conform to past practice and cultural ideals, but military performance <em>is judged against results</em>.  Consequently, military performance becomes the &#8216;proof in the pudding,&#8217; as it were, for the other two: a king that is successful on the battlefield must be so because they rule well in peacetime (and thus have a well-run kingdom with a good army) and because whatever Higher Powers may be interested were on their side.  That then feeds back into the model of kingship: because the ideal king is successful on the battlefield, the actual king <em>must seek battlefields on which to be successful</em>.  The <em>performance</em> of kingship by the socially constructed models present in these societies <em>demands</em> military performance and so conflicts must be found to do that performance.</p>



<p>The balance of <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s prestige system pushes the player in exactly this direction, since the secular opinion bonuses of fame are so high and the best way to get fame is to spend prestige declaring wars you then win.  That allows vassal opinion to be kept high (and some high opinion rolls over to your ruler&#8217;s heir for a few years after succession), because the king is <em>doing kingship</em> (here, military activity) well.</p>



<p>The game then mirrors this same structure for the &#8216;chief judge&#8217; role as well with the Royal Court DLC.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/02/18/miscellanea-thoughts-on-ckiii-royal-court/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2022/02/18/miscellanea-thoughts-on-ckiii-royal-court/">I&#8217;ve discussed this DLC already</a> but here I want to briefly note how it adopts the same prestige/fame economy: it costs prestige to hold court (you can do so every five years).  Doing so gives your character three dilemmas to resolve; getting favorable resolutions either by leveraging the treasury (vassals like generous kings!) or by being wise and skilled rewards further prestige and all gains of prestige are gains in fame, so the player spends political capital (the prestige investment) for the chance to win legitimacy (fame if you perform well).  The effects aren&#8217;t nearly as strong as warfare and that makes a lot of sense: these are <em><strong>military aristocrats</strong></em>, after all.  But it fits in the same mold.</p>



<p>However fame, while a major component of how the game models legitimacy, is not the only system for doing so.  Remember that there are a <em>lot</em> of either general opinion or vassal opinion modifiers.  Fame is one of the largest, but a character&#8217;s traits (like Brave or Just, but as we&#8217;ll see these can be culture and religion specific too!) matter.  A number of lifestyle traits also boost opinion either directly (like &#8216;Administrator,&#8217; +5 vassal opinion) or indirectly through a diplomacy bonus (like the &#8216;Eager reveler&#8217; trait from doing lots of feasting, but beware because a character that does that can also pick up the &#8216;drunkard&#8217; trait which is sharply disapproved of by some but not all religions/cultures!).  On the other hand, holding personally more territory than you can inherit upsets vassals, as does acts of tyranny, but also acts a culture disapproves of (which can vary, culture to culture, see below).</p>



<p><strong>Consequently, the way <em>CKIII</em> models legitimacy is through a multitude of bonuses and penalties which bear on vassal opinion</strong>.  <em>Collectively</em> the things that provide bonuses to vassal opinion &#8211; high fame (from military success), good diplomacy, holding feasts, giving fair judgement, commissioning histories of your house and displaying them &#8211; all <em>together</em> form the game&#8217;s model of building legitimacy through performing a sort of ideal kingship in line with cultural expectations.  By contrast, doing the things which provide <em>penalties</em> to vassal opinion &#8211; tanking fame by declaring wars without &#8216;just cause&#8217; (the prestige to pay for it), committing crimes, having culturally or religiously disapproved of traits or lifestyles and so &#8211; do the inverse, undermining a character&#8217;s legitimacy and promoting the formation of dangerous factions that undermine the unity of the kingdom.  <strong>Legitimacy is very present in CKIII, not as a single system, but as an interaction of many systems which in turn influence vassal behavior.</strong></p>



<p>That said, we&#8217;ve been talking a lot about <em>general</em> features &#8211; every ruler is using prestige and fame (and the religious equivalents, piety and devotion, which naturally speak to the &#8216;chief priest&#8217; kingship role).  But of course as implied by the constructivist framing here, these roles are <em>socially constructed</em> (which again, just means &#8216;a thing that humans made rather than a thing that occurs in nature without humans.&#8217;  &#8216;Socially constructed&#8217; does not mean &#8216;fake.&#8217;)<span id='easy-footnote-6-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-15532' title='By way of example, which side of the road we drive on is socially constructed and entirely contingent.

What a &#8216;good king&#8217; looks like in one society isn&#8217;t going to be precisely what a &#8216;good king&#8217; looks like in another, and so the job of building legitimacy is going to change from one to the other.</p>



<p>Which brings us to&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Legitimacy, Culture and Religion  </h2>



<p>The way that <em>CKIII</em> deals with both culture and religion represents a significant shift from <em>CKII</em>.  In the earlier game there were a set number of cultures and religions, some with bespoke mechanics (most religions and a few cultures) but the whole system was fairly inflexible and yet at the same time often had minimal impact on gameplay.  The main impact of the system was merely to make multicultural realms less stable and efficient than monocultural realms.</p>



<p>By contrast, culture and religion are much more complexly modeled in <em>CKIII</em> and &#8211; important for this post &#8211; have an impact on the game&#8217;s understanding of legitimacy.  Both culture and religion are, in the first place, <em>modular</em>.  Each culture consists of an ethos (one of seven core values), four &#8216;pillars&#8217; (language, but also an aesthetic which determines how characters of the culture dress, etc.), and then a series of traditions.  <a href="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Traditions" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Traditions">Traditions are modular quirks of individual cultures</a>, such as a preference for certain kinds of soldiers (heavy infantry, archers, etc.), familiarity with certain kinds of terrain, a tradition of monasticism, or traditions around activities like feasting or dueling.  There are a lot of these and they can have a modest but noticable impact on gameplay, especially where they allow certain activites to occur more often or be taken without gateway perks (e.g. &#8216;Tabletop Warriors&#8217; for cultures that place a high value on board games like chess, which in turn makes being challenged to friendly (or not so friendly) board games a regular occurrence).  This modular structure also allows the game to simulate cultural blending and drift more easily (and giving the player some agency in it).</p>

These are modular and the player can try to start a new branch of their religion or, as the largest ruler of a given culture, try to reshape their culture (though the prestige cost is considerable, reflecting the tremendous political capital needed to make such changes &#8216;stick.&#8217;)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Religion is similarly modular in how it is modeled.  Characters each have a faith which is then part of a religion which is then part of a religious family, which allows the game to distinguish between different religions, branches of religions, heterodoxies and heresies within those branches and so on.  Like culture, each faith has a set of tenets which inform its function in game, both a set of modular bonuses much like culture traditions but also a set of doctrines on the role of the clergy, marriage and what acts are considered criminal or shunned.  Each religion (so a bundle of faiths) also has its own list of &#8216;virtues&#8217; (preferred traits) and &#8216;sins&#8217; (disfavored traits).</p>



<p>The combined effect of all of these little factors is to change, sometimes in subtle ways but often in quite pronounced ones, what traits and actions improve or damage a liege&#8217;s standing among their vassals, which is to say what traits and actions build or damage legitimacy.  The differences are generally fairly small &#8211; no in-game religion prefers cowards or murderers to brave or just people, for instance &#8211; but then the range of human moral codes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law">is not infinite either</a>.  Nevertheless, a vengeful hard-feasting (and hard-drinking) Norse-religion ruler with a high martial education and the &#8216;poet&#8217; trait in a culture with the &#8216;Chanson de Geste&#8217; cultural tradition is going to be highly regarded: vengeful and poet are both favored by the religion and martial education by the cultural trait.  But take that same ruler traits but put them in a Muslim context and suddenly the hard-drinking <em>damages</em> the character&#8217;s appeal to others; put the character in a Byzantine context and vengeful is now a serious character flaw (global opinion malus) while that character&#8217;s martial prowess, while not disapproved of, provides no general opinion bonus.</p>



<p>Meanwhile some of these tenets and traditions open up entirely new interactions or substantially change existing ones.  Several traditions, like Druzhina and Futuwaa open up the option to have either serious to-the-death duels or sparring duels.  Different faiths have different understandings of religious war and pilgrimage, even within a single religion, leading to different activities and bonuses for doing them.  Thus a Muslim ruler can earn some legitimacy (general opinion bonus) by performing the Hajj; most Christian rulers can do something similar with a Christian pilgrimage, whereas for the Tengri with the &#8216;ancestor worship&#8217; tenet, doing so only grants a close family opinion modifier.</p>



<p>If anything, as a historian <strong>I wish these impacts were much stronger</strong>, encouraging very different forms of royal display and action.  One difference that jumps out to me as not being modeled as fully are cultural assumptions about the king&#8217;s role in the army.  My sense is that most players keep their ruler out of army leadership because that is a high risk profession and surprise successions are bad, but in a lot of cultures that choice for an adult male ruler should be effectively impossible or at least badly politically damaging.  Attitudes in different cultures here shifted over time, which makes a good fit for the culture system&#8217;s traditions, which can also change over time.<span id='easy-footnote-7-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-15532' title='By way of example early Roman emperors absolutely did not lead armies in the field, a norm that weakened in the second century AD and then inverted in the third.  By the end of the third century the emperor always moved with the main field army, the &lt;em&gt;comitatenses&lt;/em&gt;.  But that norm wasn&amp;#8217;t stable either; by the early Middle Ages Eastern Roman Emperors were back to dispatching subordinates with the armies, as Justinian (r. 527-565) did, until the practice changed &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; with Heraclius (r. 610-641).'><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>



<p>I suspect this is the direction the game is trending in any event.  The &#8216;Tabletop Warriors&#8217; and &#8216;Malleable Subjects&#8217; traditions added with the Iberia DLC are both relatively more impactful on gameplay, the former leading to a different form of culturally important activity (lots of chess), while the latter changes the shape your kingdom takes culturally, making multicultural realms more stable.  Looking at what the developers are talking about in terms of what kind of content they intend to make, it seems safe to bet that future cultural flavor packs are likely to come with more impactful culture traditions or religious tenets, especially using new traditions as the &#8216;wrappers&#8217; to contain a whole bunch of new event lines.  I hope this is the direction they go; the system here seems to provide a good <em>foundation</em> to express the many different models of rulership at work in this period, but as of now that foundation isn&#8217;t fully utilized.</p>

With a diplomacy of 21, a diplomatic education and the diplomatic court trait, Muntasir is well equipped to manage.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Performing Kingship</h2>



<p>Nevertheless, I think the overall focus on rulership (which, when the developers discuss the game tends to be discussed under the heading of &#8216;roleplay&#8217; but since the only role you play is some form of ruler, the overlap is considerable) is broadly successful and also quite innovative for a strategy title.  Getting that to work in <em>CKIII</em> requires all three of the design elements that we&#8217;ve discussed so far. Fragmentation is necessary so that the player has subordinates whose opinions matter, rather than merely opponents to be defeated, while the personalistic system of rule encourages the player to think about how their actions will impact the views and behaviors of peers, vassals and their liege (should they have one).</p>



<p>With those pillars in place, the game doesn&#8217;t have to pull the player out for a lecture on constructivism or kingship: instead players are going to rapidly note, especially when running a large realm that anything with a general opinion or vassal opinion bonus is <em>very valuable</em> to realm stability and that staying king or emperor over multiple generations is going to require racking up as many of those things as possible.  And off the player goes, performing kingship (or failing to do so and finding their realm cracks up under the pressure of faction wars).  In the process it provides a striking example of how often foreign policy is domestic policy by other means, as players routinely will use foreign policy (especially warfare) as a potential solution for domestic policy problems, which <em>works</em> in societies where military success is the ultimate marker of successful kingship.</p>



<p>And I can&#8217;t stress how unusual this approach, trying to get the player to <em>play</em> like a historical figure and to understand the concerns that shaped their behavior, is in this genre.  Short of ultra-niche titles like <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/352220/King_of_Dragon_Pass/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://store.steampowered.com/app/352220/King_of_Dragon_Pass/">King of Dragon Pass</a></em>, most strategy games never put the player in a situation where the cultural and institutional constraints on their actions are so extensively modeled.  Instead, most historical strategy games put the player in charge of a unitary state with near absolute power.  To the degree that culture or religion are modeled, they more often exist the way that they do in the <em>Civilization</em> games, as beliefs for <em>other people</em><span id='easy-footnote-8-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-15532' title='&lt;a href=&quot;https://acoup.blog/2019/10/25/collections-practical-polytheism-part-i-knowledge/&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; data-id=&quot;1479&quot;&gt;And you know how much &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; vision of past religions frustrates me&lt;/a&gt;!'><sup>8</sup></a></span> which are putty to be molded into the desired form by the player&#8217;s will, rather than as long-lasting <em>structures</em> which shape and constrain actors.<span id='easy-footnote-9-15532' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-15532' title='Structures here is (&lt;em&gt;surprise!&lt;/em&gt;) another idea out of the &lt;em&gt;Annales&lt;/em&gt; school, which divides history conceptually into three: short-term changes (&amp;#8216;events&amp;#8217; or &lt;em&gt;événements&lt;/em&gt;), mid-term shifting conditions and periods of rapid change (&amp;#8216;conjunctures&amp;#8217;) and then &lt;em&gt;la longue &lt;em&gt;durée&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, long-term historical structures (geography, climate, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;mentalités&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, etc.).  The &lt;em&gt;Annales&lt;/em&gt; approach is explicit in prioritizing those structures over the other two, though of course sometimes major events can fundamentally alter underlying structures.'><sup>9</sup></a></span>  </p>



<p>But in <em>CKIII</em>, religion and culture are not &#8216;for other people,&#8217; but rather are fundamental shaping constraints on the possibility space for the player; culture is the sandbox they must play in.  There are other sandboxes they could move to, but in all cases there will be a box and they will be in it.  <strong><em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s design, built around personal rule, allow it to consider systems that are larger than any one ruler, and that is fantastic.</strong></p>



<p>Now I should note that we&#8217;ve ignored the other component of how the game simulates legitimacy, the &#8216;popular opinion&#8217; modifier, which we&#8217;ll get to next week as we take a look at how <em>CKIII</em> handles armies, unconventional polities and the <em>other</em> half of the vassalage-manorialism pair that makes up feudalism.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is the back half of the second part of a four part series (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/16/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-i-making-it-personal/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/23/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iia-rascally-vassals/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/">IIb</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/07/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iii-constructivisting-a-kingdom/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/10/14/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iv-emperors-soldiers-and-peasants/">IV</a>) examining the historical assumptions behind the popular medieval grand strategy game <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, made by Paradox Interactive.  Last time we looked at how the game tried to mechanically simulate the internal structure of the highly fragmented polities of Christian Europe from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries.  While that model has some necessary simplifications (both in flattening noble &#8216;ranks&#8217; to a single system and in avoiding vassals with multiple lieges), on the whole it is a very capable simulation of vassalage-based decentralized polities, given the constraints of game design.</p>



<p>This week we&#8217;re going to take the same question and turn both East and South to the medieval Islamic world.  I sometimes find that students often assume that while medieval Europe was fragmented and decentralized that the Islamic world must have been unified with stronger central governments.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15394' title='As best I can tell this is a product of teachers attempting to compensate for older, orientalizing views which presented Islamic polities as uniformly &amp;#8216;decadent,&amp;#8217; weak and backwards as compared to European polities and perhaps somewhat overcorrecting.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>  But as we&#8217;ll see from a political standpoint both halves of the broader Mediterranean world faced similar problems with fragmentation and decentralization, with similar results produced by somewhat different causes.</p>



<p>Consequently, while it is clear that the basic structure of vassalage that <em>CKIII</em> employs was designed first for the fragmented polities of Christendom, it isn&#8217;t necessarily a terrible fit for the Islamic world of the period either.  That said, clearly some adjustments would need to be made, so this week we&#8217;re going to assess what adjustments <em>CKIII</em> makes to this system to reflect Muslim polities in this period and the degree to which they are successful.</p>



<p>It is worth a brief note on the way that the <em>Crusader Kings</em> series has developed, because while the systems for &#8216;feudal&#8217; vassalage were largely an iteration on the existing model established by <em>Crusader Kings II</em>, <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s system for modeling Islamic polities differently &#8211; the &#8216;clan&#8217; government type&#8217; &#8211; essentially jettisons <em>most</em> of <em>CKII</em>&#8216;s systems and starts over.  Crucially, Islamic polities were simply <em>not playable</em> in <em>CKII</em> on release, with the option to play them only being added with the <em>Sword of Islam</em> expansion, which also introduced their mechanics.  In particular, <em>CKII</em> gave most Muslim rulers a unique government form (&#8216;Iqta&#8217;) which enabled rulers to hold both castle and temple holdings directly (this is kept) and also had a higher default tax rate (this is modified heavily).  Fragmentation was then encouraged through the <a href="https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Decadence" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Decadence">decadence system</a>, which offered large modifiers to levy morale and demesne income based on the &#8216;decadence&#8217; of a ruling family, which was largely determined by the number of unlanded members of the dynasty.  The idea of this system, one supposes, was that a polity would expand with very low decadence (because dynasty members would be easy to put on newly conquered holdings), but with a polygamous marriage system this would produce explosively large later generations as expansion slowed, causing decadence to rise to weaken and then fracture the kingdom.  The system frankly never quite worked and doesn&#8217;t seem to me to have been well-regarded, so it isn&#8217;t surprising that <em>CKIII</em> largely starts over from scratch.  Of course the other major design difference we must note here is that Islamic characters were playable in <em>CKIII</em> at launch, which is already a huge improvement at embracing the diversity of medieval Afro-Eurasia.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Different Path to Fragmentation</h2>



<p>I would argue that political fragmentation is one of the defining features of the Middle Ages in the broader Mediterranean (which is to say &#8216;of the Middle Ages,&#8217; since I don&#8217;t think this chronological signifier has a lot of usefulness beyond that region), <em><strong>but not all political fragmentation is the same</strong></em>.  The medieval Islamic world fragmented politically in this period just like post-Carolingian Europe, to the degree that by the time of the Crusades (1095-1291) the political structures on both sides of those conflicts were broadly recognizable to each other, <strong>but that process which produced that fragmentation was quite different and it produced different government structures</strong>.<span id='easy-footnote-2-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15394' title='I should note here that for many of the Arabic or Persian words I&amp;#8217;m going to use here there are a range of transliterations into English, including a lot of variation in terms of diacritical marks.  I don&amp;#8217;t know either of those languages, but I have tried to at least observe common transliterations (albeit generally with minimal diacritical marks as these are difficult to do in the WordPress editor and often not used in transliteration in any event).  My apologies in advance for any errors I have doubtlessly made due to my unfamiliarity with the languages.'><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Now the game itself begins in 867, by which point the Abbasid Caliphate &#8211; itself a <em>product</em> of this fragmentation, having been the largest splinter of the Umayyad Caliphate&#8217;s breakdown &#8211; was already beginning to fragment itself, but to understand the process that produced this fragmentation, we ought to back up a bit further and start with the initial large Islamic polity, the Rashidun Caliphate (632-661).  Now as you will recall from last week, one of the major problems that led to political fragmentation in Europe was that the highly centralized Roman bureaucracy simply did not survive into the Middle Ages and the educated bureaucrats did not exist to reconstruct it, forcing the polities that followed to &#8216;make do&#8217; without a strong central bureaucracy.</p>



<p><strong>This is not the case in the East. </strong> In a sense, the early Caliphs were facing a similar problem to the one the Carolingians had: having effected a grand conquest how to both militarily hold on to those lands and then also administer them.  However, there was a key difference: whereas the Carolingians had overrun other small fragmented polities with limited administrative apparatuses, the initial expansion of the Rashidun Caliphate instead involved overrunning the eastern chunk of the still-extant and functional Eastern Roman Empire and absorbing entirely its great rival, the Sassanid Empire.  Both <em><strong>states </strong></em>&#8211; and here I get to use that word! &#8211; were centrally administered by a capable and developed bureaucracy, a necessary product of their <em>long</em> conflicts against each other.  Thus Abu-Bakr and later Rashidun Caliphs found themselves with a ready-made administrative system, complete with bureaucrats, that they could just repurpose to collect revenues, <strong>which is precisely what they did</strong>.</p>



<p>In order to <em>hold</em> the territory, they established a series of &#8216;garrison cities&#8217; &#8211; permanently settled military forces; essentially armed communities of Muslims acting as the nails which provided the force to secure Caliphal political authority.  However, Islamic armies are mostly not coming from an agrarian context so the normal expedient of military-settlers (giving each soldier a plot of land to farm in peace time) isn&#8217;t available because these fellows aren&#8217;t farmers.  Islam <em>already</em> had a religiously encoded system for revenue collection in a series of religious rules for collecting taxes, a land tax (the <em>kharaj</em>) and head tax (the <em>jizya</em>) for non-Muslims and the provision of alms (<em>zakat</em>) for Muslims, with the latter being formalized as a state tax by the first Caliph, Abu Bakr.  Because the Sassanid and Byzantine administrative bureaucracies for tax collection <em>already existed</em>, they could simply be put to work collecting taxes on this new regime (not actually so different from the old one), providing a steady and indeed comparatively massive stream of revenues to the state.  Which then leaves the problem of our non-farmer military settlers.</p>

This is the polity &#8211; covering an absolutely massive area &#8211; which is going to fracture progressively smaller over the next two centuries until it effectively ceases to exist.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The solution was the <em>diwan</em>-system.  The word <em>diwan</em> comes from an Old Persian word meaning a formal state list or ledger, though it eventually came to mean &#8216;government department&#8217; or the official who ran such a department.  The very first <em>diwan</em> so established was the <em>diwan al-jund</em> created by the Caliph Umar in 641, as a list of Muslim warriors whose participation in the conquests entitled them (and eventually their heirs) to the payment of a salary (<em>ata</em>) and a food ration (<em>rizq</em>).  It also functioned as a muster roll, so you both knew who you had to pay in peacetime and who could be called up in war.  However, as Patricia Crone puts it, &#8220;it was not so much an institution for the maintenance of armies as one for the maintenance of Muslims.&#8221;<span id='easy-footnote-3-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15394' title='P. Crone, &amp;#8220;The Early Islamic World&amp;#8221; in K. Raaflaub and N. Rosenstein, &lt;em&gt;War and Society in the Ancient and Mediterranean Worlds&lt;/em&gt; (1999), 313.  Much of what follows here is adapted from Crone&amp;#8217;s summary there.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>  The payments are thus untethered to any <em>actual</em> military service.  They also seem to eat basically all of the revenues that the tax system is generating, leaving only a relatively small amount to float up to the Caliph.<span id='easy-footnote-4-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15394' title='This was an element of &lt;em&gt;CKII&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s design I actually thought was curious.  We see pretty clear evidence of persistent revenue problems for the Umayyads and Abbasids over time and part of the problem is clearly that revenues get eaten up by local garrison communities before reaching the imperial &amp;#8216;center&amp;#8217; in Damascus or Baghdad.  That in turn leads to taxes which were initially only imposed on non-Muslims (a slowly shrinking tax base, as slowly, bit by bit over time more and more of those tax-payers convert), particular the &lt;em&gt;kharaj&lt;/em&gt; land tax, being imposed on Muslims as well, with substantial resistance to this as well.  Yet in &lt;em&gt;CKII&lt;/em&gt; it is just a &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; feature of Islamic &amp;#8216;Iqta&amp;#8217; government that the central government gets a higher proportion of tax revenues; this is a point on which, we will see, &lt;em&gt;CKIII&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s clan-government system is an improvement.'><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>The problem is how this dovetails with the consensus-based model of political decision-making.  These garrison communities naturally had their own leaders, whose support the Caliph could not effectively compel (because they subsist off of local revenues, not state revenues), with an intermediate layer of provincial governors generally chosen from among the Caliph&#8217;s close relatives, especially as we move from the Rashidun Caliphs to the Umayyads.  However these governors both lacked the hard-edged tools to coerce these Muslim communities (who again, are still largely ruling over a yet larger non-Muslim population) because they lacked military force separate from them, but they also lacked a cultural script (like a tradition of conscription into a citizen militia, for instance) which would enable them to compel these fellows to fight if they didn&#8217;t want to.</p>

As you can see on the map below, this polity would continue to fragment, but even by this point Sicily and Tunis (under the Aghlabids) are also lost in all but name.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Consequently we see a series of power struggles where a given dynasty has firm control only over the garrison communities close to its capital and tries &#8211; often in vain &#8211; to use that military base to maintain control over the rest of the empire.  The far-flung garrison communities then in turn react negatively to any move away from what they see as the ancestral and appropriate consensus mode of government, though of course for such a massive empire consensus-systems were hardly going to work either.  The Umayyads, with their base in Syria try it first, holding together for less than a hundred years (661-750), before losing to the Abbasids, whose base was in Mesopotamia, which proved equally unable to hold all of the other Muslim garrison-communities by force of arms.  The Abbasids fairly quickly lose control over Spain (756), Morocco (788), North Africa and Sicily (800) and then the greater Iranian region (c. 870) and Egypt (969), as the Muslim communities (and their leaders) in each region exerted their independence.  <strong>The fundamental problem was that no region had enough of a concentration of military force to hold the rest by pure force, but the system and cultural script available did not have another mode of legitimacy which was functional at this scale</strong>.</p>



<p>The Abbasid response to this problem was to look for military force <em>outside</em> the traditional <em>diwan</em>-system.  The &#8216;solution&#8217; arrived at were the Mamluks, slave soldiers drawn predominately from Turkic-language speakers from the western Eurasian Steppe which conveniently bordered the Abbasid Caliphate on its northern side.  Warfare on the Steppe tended to &#8216;<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/08/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-iv-screamers-and-howlers/" data-type="post" data-id="5675">throw off</a>&#8216; significant numbers of captured slaves who, as steppe nomads, were already capable fighters and Abbasids could also already draw on Arab cultural traditions whereby clan elites might maintain a personal retinue of enslaved soldier-bodyguards.  It was thus a fairly direct matter to use the vast wealth of their empire to expand that bodyguard into a serious military force to support central authority.  And these fellows were <em>very good</em> at fighting; steppe nomads made the most effective horse archers anywhere in the world, a system of fighting that the Arabs also used (and so were familiar with) and which was <em>extremely</em> effective.  And, being cultural outsiders who were never working within the Arab model of consensus government, Mamluks could be used to &#8216;police&#8217; the garrison communities.</p>

In the West the largest break away were the Tulunids in Africa while in the East the Saffarids broke away with the most densely populated parts of the Iranian Plateau (both are represented as independent states in CKIII although they nominally were subordinate to the Caliph).  By the mid-900s, the Abbasids would lose real political power even in the core of their domains.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem, of course, is that establishing an ethnically distinct enslaved soldier class is politically unstable, leading to further fragmentation and military weakness.  The first effort at creating a significant Mamluk slave-soldier corps was under the Caliph al-Mu&#8217;tasim (833-842); the first Mamluk revolt (a coup, really) occurred in 861, just 19 years after his death.  That said, the resources for this system and the cultural script for its implementation were available in many places in the Islamic world and so the system was repeatedly implemented and then repeatedly exploded in the same predictable way.  Successful Mamluk revolts ensued in Afghanistan (the Ghaznavids, 977-1186), and central Asia more broadly (the Khwarazmian Shah, 1077-1231) and in India (the Delhi Mamluks, 1206-1290) and in Egypt (the Mamluk Sultinate, 1250-1517).  On top of which was the incursion in much of the Middle East of the Turks themselves (initially the Seljuks), which was in turn partly enabled by the fact that &#8211; perhaps unsurprisingly &#8211; Turkish Mamluks didn&#8217;t necessarily see the arrival of a <em>Turkish</em> invading force as something to be fought.  The Turks then had the same fragmentation problem as the later Mongols would and one that should be immediately familiar to <em>Crusader Kings </em>players: partitive inheritance on the steppe model, leading directly to rapid political fragmentation through inheritance.</p>



<p>Patricia Crone sums up this process ably, I think:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In a sense the Abbasids were in the same boat as the Carolingians.&nbsp; Both were confronted with the task of creating polities for which their tribal past offered no models, but which could not simply be revised versions of the empires their ancestors had overrun, in the west because the fiscal and administrative machinery had collapsed…in the east because the desire was absent even though the machinery had survived.&nbsp; Both fell back on private ties, and in both cases the outcome was political fragmentation.&nbsp; But because the fiscal and administrative machinery survived in the east, the Abbasids could simply buy the retainers they needed, and so they lost their power not to lords and vassals but to freedmen.<span id='easy-footnote-5-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-15394' title='Crone, &lt;em&gt;op. cit.&lt;/em&gt; 326.'><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the one hand the result here is fragmented and personalistic, much like situation in Western Europe and so the basic applicability of <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s systems seems good.  On the other hand, these are systems that emerged out of different circumstances and while they both trended towards similar fragmentation, did so for somewhat different reasons and with different results.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clan Governments</h2>



<p>To represent this system, <em>CKIII</em> makes a few modifications to the systems we discussed last week.  <strong>Islamic polities nearly always have the &#8216;clan&#8217; government form</strong>.  Clan vassals differ in two major respects from feudal vassals: first, their levy and revenue contribution is not fixed but varies based on opinion.  This means that clan vassals with very low opinion might offer effectively nothing, but at very high opinion clan vassals can contribute substantially <em>more</em> than even the most extreme feudal contracts (which are very rare).  The second major difference is that clan vassals suffer a relations penalty if they do not have an alliance with their liege (in addition to just being vassals).  With just a few exceptions, alliances in <em>CKIII</em> generally require a close family tie by either blood or marriage, so this is essentially a way of saying that clan vassals which are unrelated to or distant relations from their liege suffer an opinion penalty and as a result supply fewer taxes or levies.  Clan governments also get access to conquest <em>casus belli</em>, making it easier to wage aggressive war for territory both within their religious group and outside, though there is a piety/prestige cost.</p>



<p>There is another significant difference I do want to note briefly.  We&#8217;ll get into how religion functions in the game next time, but I do want to note that <em>most</em> branches of Islam as represented in the game have the &#8216;Jizya&#8217; tenet, which increases tax revenues for countries of a different faith than the holder, while increasing levy reinforcement rate for counties of the same faith as the holder.  It also makes available a special vassal contract by the same name which does the same for a vassal (increases tax contribution, decreased levies).  This can be a significant change in realm structure, particular in the 867 start where most major Islamic polities begin controlling sizeable regions which don&#8217;t share their religion (religion is modeled by the game on a county-by-county basis, so the game cannot generally simulate religious minorities within counties, although a number of events pointedly note their existence).  In addition, nearly all of the branches of Islam as represented in the game have the &#8216;polygamous&#8217; marriage type, which encourages (via penalties to piety) rulers to have multiple wives based on their rank.</p>



<p>Now there&#8217;s an important mechanical interaction here worth noting.  As I&#8217;ve already noted (especially in the running commentary for my al-Yiliq game), partitive inheritance is a <em>substantial</em> factor in the player&#8217;s experience for much of the game.  Apart from the Byzantines who start with it, pure primogeniture (eldest child gets everything, everyone else gets nothing) as a succession law <em>cannot</em> be acquired before 1200; &#8216;high partition&#8217; which at least gives the eldest heir half of the holdings before splitting the rest between the rest cannot be acquired before 1050 (and in most cases not for a generation or two after that).  Consequently rulers, especially highly ranked rulers who tend to have <em>lots</em> of sons are going to spend much of the game splitting their domain between <em>all of those sons</em> in each generation.</p>



<p>So Muslim clan rulers are likely to have many heirs, partitive inheritance and access to a fairly readily usable <em>casus belli</em> to seize territory.  What that combines to produce is a situation where powerful or aggressive rulers expand aggressively, looking to accumulate enough territory to pass on to their multiple heirs to avoid fractionalizing their core demesne (and thus weakening the main heir).  In the first generation, that produces a whole bunch of brothers who as close blood relatives can immediately conclude alliances with them, which is very handy if either one of them is the liege of the rest (because it removes that &#8216;clan vassal with no alliance penalty&#8217;) or if the family collectively are all vassals of the same non-related liege and are looking to form a powerful political bloc to potentially seize power.</p>



<p>But in <em>successive</em> generations things begin to unravel unless one has planned carefully.  In the next generation down, what were brothers are now just cousins, which is not close enough to form an alliance without a marriage connection.  Moreover, strategically, everyone is now looking for <em>yet more conquests</em> to find land for <em>yet more heirs</em>, so what was once a coherent power-bloc within he realm is now divided against itself.  A diligent liege can hold it together with strategic marriages (having many sons also means having many daughters), but as the generations roll on and the kingdom expands those ties are going to get more and more distant, with successful &#8216;cadet&#8217; branches increasingly becoming a threat to the main branch of the house holding the top-tier title.  And because clan vassal opinion impacts levies and taxes, the swing in power is even more dramatic, from close relatives with opinion bonuses from close relations and interlocking alliances (who thus give more levies and money) to distant relatives without those bonuses and angry that there aren&#8217;t enough alliance-forming marriage to go around (who thus give less).  Consequently realms tend to be coherent and powerful when expanding in their first few generations, but then even more than monogamous feudal realms, divide against themselves, fragment and weaken as expansion slows and clan-cohesion for the ruling house breaks down.</p>



<p>And this is one of those wonderful cases (as with Marc Bloch above) where I am almost <em>certain</em> I know what the developers were reading when they planned these mechanics, because this seems like a fairly direct effort to implement Abu Zayd &#8216;Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Khaldun al-Hadrami&#8217;s &#8211; or just Ibn Khaldun as we generally refer to him &#8211; his theory of &#8216;<em>asabiyyah</em>&#8216; or clan cohesion, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/14/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiib-myths-of-the-atreides/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/14/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiib-myths-of-the-atreides/">which we&#8217;ve touched on before</a>.  Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) was a Muslim medieval historian who wrote a world history up to his own time, with the focus on the Islamic world.  Ibn Khaldun, in assessing while different polities repeatedly rose, fragmented and fell offered <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em> as an explanatory concept.  Initially, a tightly knit social group like a nomadic clan or tribe has very strong &#8216;<em>asabiyyah</em> as the tight bonds make the members more willing to fight for each other and more willing to cooperate and reach consensus.  For such a group, force is less necessary to structure relations because of those tight clan ties.</p>



<p>That strong &#8216;<em>asabiyyah</em> in turn makes for strong military power, as the clan will be able to mobilize a high proportion of its members to fight hard and stick together.  Other, less cohesive, groups will find their members absorbed into the strong <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em>, allowing an ascendant clan or tribe to absorb its less cohesive neighbors and &#8216;snowball&#8217; as it were.  However as the group itself grows in both territory and wealth, the very clan ties that founded its strength weaken.  Members meet each other less, have fewer interests in common and the polity is also incorporating conquered or absorbed peoples.  As the <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em> thus weakens, it becomes necessary for the polity &#8211; by this point we&#8217;re trending towards a state &#8211; to replace consensus decision-making with force to <em>compel</em> cooperation.  But that&#8217;s much less effective than <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em>-cohesion, leading to weakness and fragmentation.  As that state fragments, it is in turn overtaken by groups &#8211; either within or without &#8211; with stronger <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em> and the cycle repeats.</p>



<p>Now when I last discussed Ibn Khaldun, I noted that I thought his theory has useful explanatory power but only for a subset of states: weakly consolidated empires built by nomadic or semi-nomadic (or at least tribal) peoples on top of the agrarian foundations of more complex societies.  Which makes sense, since for the six centuries prior to his life, that&#8217;s what had kept happening in Ibn Khaldun&#8217;s neck of the woods.  Where Ibn Khaldun&#8217;s explanatory power struggles, I think, is his inability to imagine a nomadic people successfully managing the transition from <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em>-based cohesion to a stable, long-lasting state based on royal or institutional legitimacy &#8211; a transition not from one form of power (clan cohesion) to a form of force (state coercion) but from one form of power to <em>another</em> form of power (state <em>legitimacy</em>).  What he could not have known is that within a century after his death the Ottomans would successfully manage that transition; of course given how rare (but not unique) and remarkable an achievement that was, Ibn Khaldun can hardly be faulted for not foreseeing it.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Ibn Khaldun&#8217;s model of &#8216;<em>asabiyyah</em> is obviously relevant for <em>this</em> period, since <em>CKIII </em>ends in January, 1453 with much of the Ottoman state-building project yet incomplete (a story, quite reasonably, for the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/04/30/collections-teaching-paradox-europa-univeralis-iv-part-i-state-of-play/" data-type="post" data-id="6992">state-focused <em>EUIV</em></a>).  And it isn&#8217;t hard to see how the various mechanics of the clan system come together to try to produce something like Ibn Khaldun&#8217;s cycles of <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em>: a house expands, forms a polity, remains very coherent and powerful for a few generations before fragmenting as the ever-more-distant ties undermine the strengths that elevated it.  And at the same time, the mechanics &#8211; particularly the opinion-penalties to levies &#8211; mirror in a limited way the increasing difficulty of raising force in this system without strong consensus (represented by high opinion).</p>



<p>If anything I would say that the core interactions of this system stumble primarily by being <em>too weak</em>.  The system set up by the Rashidun Caliphate effectively required active enthusiastic participation by its members, but in game an Islamic clan-type ruler can typically get away with begrudging acquiescence for surprisingly long, leading to a recurring problem where the major states of the Islamic world &#8211; <em>especially</em> the Abbasids &#8211; tend to be rather more durable and cohesive than they were historically (though in some ways this is typically matched by a Byzantine Empire which is often a lot more effective and powerful than it perhaps should be).  If anything, the decline in support for unhappy vassals should be substantially stronger, with contributions running down to zero quite quickly at negative opinion (though I assume this was probably tried and abandoned because it had knock-on gameplay effects that were undesirable).  As it stands now, there are enough positive opinion modifiers available to generally keep clan vassal opinion high <em>enough</em> to avoid the sort of internal decay that Ibn Khaldun was describing.</p>



<p>The other element that seems to me to be clearly missing here is the Abbasid resort to military slaves.  Mamluks would be difficult to model in game because they are a power-center that cannot really be represented as a landed constituency.  But in practice rulers like the Abbasids should be able to resort to stocking the equivalent of greater and greater numbers of men-at-arms units (that is, professional full-time troops paid directly by the ruler), at the cost of creating a political constituency in them which could revolt and seize power if given the opportunity.  Something like a landless vassal mercenary company which could be progressively expanded to replace plummeting levies as <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em> fails, but which then becomes a dangerous vassal (or vassals) if it joins a faction might work.  As it stands now, it seems odd this piece of the puzzle is missing and one hopes that perhaps a future DLC will try to reflect this pattern in the mechanics as well.  Perhaps with a developed system for representing Mamluks, it might be possible to intensify the impacts of declining <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em> without breaking the delicate balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean.<span id='easy-footnote-6-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-15394' title='And that balance of power needs to work because players in a game called &lt;em&gt;Crusader Kings&lt;/em&gt; expect something approaching the historical crusades to be possible, which means that there both needs to be a functioning Byzantine Empire through the High Middle Ages and that it also needs to be opposed by powerful Muslim polities to its East.'><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>On the one hand, I hope that the major Muslim polities outside of Spain (which got treated in the <em>Struggle for Iberia</em> DLC) are going to get a fairly substantial mechanics-and-flavor passes in subsequent DLC to build on these mechanics.  I&#8217;ve already mentioned Mamluks, but some mechanism to recognize the distinction between the <em>appointed</em> governors in the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates (generally relatives of the Caliph) and the actual local leaders of the garrison communities would be good as well, though it would require a system for handling count-and-baron tier <em>indirect</em> vassals revolting against the king or emperor because they hate their duke-tier appointed governor, which the game currently cannot do.<span id='easy-footnote-7-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-15394' title='Perhaps some kind of use of the popular revolt faction mechanics, whereby when discontent with indirect vassals becomes high enough it triggers a major revolt in those far-flung regions?'><sup>7</sup></a></span>  But on the other hand, I think the basic structure here is actually quite good at capturing at least some of the historical dynamics that made and then fragmented these historical polities.

The Detente ending does a number of things for my goals.  It permanently enables interfaith marriages on the peninsula, which is going to matter for binding together a multi-faith realm and it massively increases cultural acceptance between the cultures in question, which doubles with Muwalladism&#8217;s &#8216;adaptive&#8217; trait (reducing the penalties for different-faith vassals) and the bonuses for Andalusian Culture&#8217;s &#8216;malleable subjects&#8217; tradition (reduces penalties for different-culture vassals).  The result gives me a <strong>bonus</strong> rather than a penalty when dealing with different-culture vassals in Iberia and substantially reduces penalties for different faith vassals.  This is of course a very ahistorical solution, but at the same time a regional policy of <strong>cuius regio, euis religio</strong> as the conclusion of a long period of strife isn&#8217;t so wildly implausible and I rather like that the game lets the player build a different sort of polity this way.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Simulating Fragmentation</h2>



<p><em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s approach, particularly the need to fashion the game around a standard set of mechanics that work similarly for everyone, has its limitations.  One limitation we haven&#8217;t mentioned yet (but which looms quite large) is that while the <em>game</em> does not feature any states, these actual regions <em>historically did </em>and <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s systems struggle to model them, a point we&#8217;ll return to later.  Nevertheless <em>CKIII</em> largely succeeds in providing a historically rooted simulation &#8211; albeit with major simplifications &#8211; of the pressures of fragmentation and even efforts at later centralization in the period.</p>



<p>Readers who are not deep into the historical gaming space may not realize <em>just how rare</em> this effort at reflecting political fragmentation is.  Nearly all of the most popular games in this space feature absurdly unitary states.  The <em>Civilization</em> games (and their -alikes, like <em>Old World</em> and <em>Humankind</em>) present not merely states but <em>nation-states</em> forming in pre-history (with a common culture, language and political structure) and proceeding without fragmentation to the present, a system where states are unitary <em>before the invention of the state</em>.  Both <em>Medieval: Total War</em> and <em>Medieval II: Total War</em> feature fully unitary states where the player is in complete command of all of the levers of policy, as does <em>Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia</em>.  The same goes for <em>Age of Empires</em> and similar real-time strategy games (e.g. <em>Rise of Nations</em>).  The <em>Mount &amp; Blade</em> series does feature non-unitary states, with kingdoms divided into a ruling clan and vassal clans, but those clans never in-fight amongst each other and the system has only a single tier of vassals (so no vassals of vassals), meaning that the kingdom largely still goes to war together.</p>



<p>Instead, political fragmentation within a polity is a theme largely left to narrative-driven roleplaying games (e.g. <em>Tyranny</em>, which not nearly enough of you have played), where it is narrated, not simulated.  <em>Crusader Kings III</em>&#8216;s effort to actually try to <em><strong>simulate</strong></em> fragmented polities is thus already pretty unusual.  And the task was clearly very hard!  Fragmented political systems are all about &#8216;fuzzy&#8217; distinctions, situations where &#8216;the rules&#8217; may or may not apply, actors whose loyalties and relative position in the system are often in flux and devilishly hard to define.  In short, these are systems that resist simulation in general and particularly resist being reduced to game systems that in the end &#8211; because of how <em>computers</em> work &#8211; must be reduced to clear numbers rather than fuzzy distinctions.</p>

The largest Christian realm was the independent, jumbo-sized Duchy of Galicia.  Because it is technically a duchy &#8211; despite being larger than three of the remaining five kingdoms on the peninsula &#8211; I have the option to offer the duke vassalage.  The bonuses offered by the Detente event, combined with a lot of diplomatic efforts (our rulers are actually personally friends) and a promise of religious protection are enough to ensure acceptance, bringing a large Christian region into the realm.  I opt to break none of the alliances I&#8217;ve made and so Ajannas II spends the rest of his quite long reign at peace, building and expanding his holdings.<br>The next goal will be creating an Empire of Hispania which can then absorb vassal kings, but that demands holding a much <strong>higher</strong> percentage of the peninsula (sigh).  Our buddy Ajannas II isn&#8217;t going to go warring like that, since he&#8217;s made friends with all of his potential opponents, so that task will be left to his son&#8230;</figcaption></figure>



<p>And despite the limitations of this effort, <strong>I think it is fair to say that as a simulation of internal political fragmentation (packed as a game that has to be fun at some point), <em>Crusader Kings III</em> succeeds</strong> and indeed succeeds remarkably so.  Some of this is due to a careful selection of time period: by beginning in 867 and ending in 1453, <em>CKIII</em> avoids having to deal with periods defined by substantially greater degrees of centralized power in most areas of the map, which allows its systems to be very focused on fragmented polities (though it also means that the game&#8217;s systems fudge the history a bit more at the edges of these time periods, as the developers have admitted).  But I think a lot of it is due to a commitment to try to simulate these political systems at a fairly high degree of granularity.  Sure, not every minor castellan or member of a town council is simulated, but nearly every polity has at least a dozen, if not dozen<em><strong>s</strong></em>, if not <em>hundreds</em> of competing power-centers represented by different kinds of vassals pursuing competing aims.  Relatedly, I don&#8217;t think it is an accident that the <em>CKIII</em> modding scene is so active.  For modders that want to simulate fragmented political systems, <em>CKIII</em> really is practically the only game in town.</p>



<p>At the same time, the simulation that is fairly clearly rooted not just in historical facts of who-ruled-what-when, <strong>but also historical understandings of the broader institutions and historical forces that shaped these fragmented polities, from Marc Bloch&#8217;s conception of feudalism as a social system to Ibn Khaldun&#8217;s theory of <em>&#8216;asabiyyah</em></strong>.  Honestly, what struck me most writing this is the surprise that the system <em>works</em>, although it has come to work through a fairly clear process of iteration: <em>Sengoku</em> (2011) seems to have been something of a test-bed for <em>Crusader Kings II</em> (2012) which was actively developed on for at least six years (it&#8217;s last expansion in 2018) before those lessons were then deployed for <em>Crusader Kings III</em> (2020).  The iteration clearly worked because each game built on the model of the previous entry in useful ways.<span id='easy-footnote-8-15394' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://acoup.blog/2022/09/30/collections-teaching-paradox-crusader-kings-iii-part-iib-cracks-in-the-house-of-islam/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-15394' title='Because yes, I actually played &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; (2011).'><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>



<p>All of that said, I think we are still missing a crucial component of <em>CKIII</em>&#8216;s core theory of political history.  We have polities and we have rulers now, but we also have to discuss how <em>CKIII</em> views <em>rulership</em>, which is where we will turn next.</p>
