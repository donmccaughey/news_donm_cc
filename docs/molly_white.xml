Because of a dispute over the admissibility of some of the planned testimony, he testified today without the jury present, and the judge will determine which &#8212; if any &#8212; of those topics can be covered tomorrow during the real thing (should he still decide to take the stand, and I am only more convinced that that&#8217;s a <em>terrible</em> idea).</p><p>Despite the fact that this was more of a dress rehearsal than the main event, his testimony still offered a lot of insight until what tomorrow might look like.</p><div id="youtube2-w6ZR0rgWB_8" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;w6ZR0rgWB_8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w6ZR0rgWB_8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div id="youtube2-lKYMX1GhuE4" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;lKYMX1GhuE4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lKYMX1GhuE4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But reading court transcripts, poring over prosecutors&#8217; exhibits, and eventually hearing secondhand accounts from journalists in the courtroom simply won&#8217;t suffice when it&#8217;s Sam Bankman-Fried himself on the stand. I have <em>got</em> to be there.</p><h3>Why is testifying such a big deal?</h3><p>Whether a defendant should take the stand in a criminal case is a major decision for any defense team. A likable, genuine-sounding, and well-controlled defendant can help to win over a jury with their testimony, making jurors more sympathetic to the defense&#8217;s version of events after hearing it in the defendant&#8217;s own words. And while jurors are reminded that it is not up to the defendant to prove their own innocence, not taking the stand sometimes leaves the impression that the defendant has something to hide.</p><p>Conversely, defendant testimony can tank a case. Not only does the defendant answer questions posed by their own friendly legal team, taking the stand also means being cross-examined by the prosecution &#8212; and the prosecutors in this case have seemed <em>extremely</em> capable. Those prosecutors can take advantage of having the defendant on the stand to ask questions they otherwise might not be able to, and (further) impeach the defendant&#8217;s credibility by catching them in a lie or drawing attention to past statements that conflict with what they say under oath. Bankman-Fried got a little squirmy even in front of regular interviewers following the FTX collapse; he doesn&#8217;t seem likely to hold up well in front of experienced cross-examiners.</p><p>Bankman-Fried is <em>not</em> the type of likable, genuine-sounding, well-controlled defendant who is apt to win over a jury. Though he undoubtedly managed to charm many people in the past, that was under vastly different circumstances: he was a (paper) billionaire sometimes described as the next J.P. Morgan, his (apparently carefully-crafted) reputation portrayed him as a young, nerdy, kind of weird innovator who was going to be the good guy in the often seedy crypto world, and his face plastered covers of magazines that ran stories about how he was planning to use all the wealth he was amassing to end suffering and make the world a better place.</p><p>But jurors are not meeting Bankman-Fried on his luxurious Bahamian home turf where he reigns over devoted employees. They&#8217;re not watching him answer softball questions by adoring interviewers onstage at glitzy crypto conferences. Instead, they&#8217;ve just spent three weeks hearing that he was a calculating, manipulative boss, friend, and boyfriend whose beliefs about risk and theft ruined the lives of countless victims. They&#8217;ve even heard how his once unruly hair and rumpled appearance were carefully engineered to build the mythology of the nerdy genius who was too busy changing the world to brush his hair, and now that that no longer serves him, they&#8217;ve discovered he&#8217;s perfectly capable of getting a haircut and putting on a suit. And for all those people who Bankman-Fried successfully won over, there were also many who found his demeanor &#8212; even before he was suspected of any wrongdoing &#8212; to be arrogant and uncaring.</p><p>And there&#8217;s a reason lawyers were trying desperately to get him to stop giving interviews following the FTX collapse: if anything he said then was untruthful, he can be confronted with those statements on the stand, and forced to make a choice: lie under oath now, or admit that he was lying then. Most defendants have some corpus of statements upon which prosecutors can draw; few have the volume Bankman-Fried has produced, and which he has helpfully packaged and delivered to prosecutors with a little bow via interviews on national TV or written statements to Congress.</p><h3>Why is Bankman-Fried testifying?</h3><p>It seems very unlikely that Bankman-Fried is testifying per the advice of his legal team. Observers have been fairly unanimous in speculating that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers have been doing everything they possibly can to keep him from testifying, because it seems like there&#8217;s almost only downside. It&#8217;s not like Bankman-Fried is going to take the stand and suddenly conjure up a convincing explanation for how everything went wrong that doesn&#8217;t involve multiple crimes on his part. If there <em>was</em> such a convincing story to be told, we would have heard it by now. Instead, the defense has been taking a scattershot approach, picking around the edges but introducing little doubt in the rather convincing explanation from prosecutors: that everything fell apart because of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s massive, intentional fraud.</p><p>A defense team can tell Bankman-Fried that testifying is a <em>terrible</em> idea. They can try to reason with him, or frighten him by regaling him with all of the possible consequences of doing so. But ultimately, they can&#8217;t <em>stop</em> him from testifying. He has a right to testify, whether they want him to or not.</p><p>Part of me wondered if he would promise his legal team that he wouldn&#8217;t testify, only to impulsively decide to take the stand at the last moment. He seems to have at least extended them the courtesy of giving them advance notice, letting them prepare their side of questioning, and hopefully coach him a little bit for what might come his way during cross-examination.</p><p>But ultimately, it seems like the decision to testify probably came from Bankman-Fried.</p><h3>Will it work?</h3><p>Bankman-Fried may well believe that he&#8217;s got such a convincing story that he&#8217;ll have the jury delivering a &#8220;not guilty&#8221; verdict by the end of his testimony. If there was one takeaway from his media tour, it was that he seemed to believe that if he just had the chance to <em>explain himself</em>, everyone would understand that he&#8217;s a good guy who certainly committed no crimes. I can sort of see where he came to this confidence &#8212; after all, there was a time when he talked venture capitalists and others into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>However, given the prosecution&#8217;s case so far and the complete lack of a case from the defense, this seems mind-bogglingly unlikely. His best hope at this point, I think, is to introduce just enough doubt with one single juror to hang the jury, preventing them from coming to a verdict at all.</p><p>Though this may be his best case scenario, it&#8217;s still not a <em>good</em> scenario. A hung jury doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the prosecution goes &#8220;oh well&#8221;, unlocks the handcuffs, and escorts Bankman-Fried out the doors onto the streets of Manhattan to wreak further havoc. There are certainly instances in which prosecutors choose not to retry cases, but with such a high-profile defendant and apparently strong case, I doubt this is one of them. At best, Bankman-Fried might find himself sitting in MDC Brooklyn for another couple of months before going through the whole thing again. There would be some advantages &#8212; he&#8217;d be going into a new case with knowledge of the prosecution&#8217;s strategy, he might be able to get better lawyers and prepare a new defense, or he could potentially finally opt to take a plea deal.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>A perhaps more likely scenario, however, is that testifying doesn&#8217;t go well for him. He could solidify his guilt in the minds of the jurors, or influence Judge Kaplan&#8217;s eventual sentencing determination.

Coinbase wants the case dismissed, based on the claim that 1) Coinbase doesn&#8217;t trade securities, and 2) the SEC is violating what&#8217;s known as the Major Questions Doctrine: the idea that agencies may not decide issues of major significance without clear direction from Congress.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> It would be surprising to see the case thrown out at this stage, but you can&#8217;t blame them for trying.</p><h3>Gemini, Genesis, and DCG</h3><p>Ever since the Genesis crypto lender halted withdrawals in November 2022 [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?collection=genesis&amp;id=genesis-crypto-lending-service-halts-withdrawals">W3IGG</a></em>], they&#8217;ve been on the receiving end of a spirited onslaught from Gemini, an exchange that has around $900 million of their customer funds stuck with Genesis. The founders of Gemini, the Winklevoss twins, have written <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/133739388/gemini-genesis-and-dcg">several <s>strongly-worded</s> cartoon supervillain-esque open letters</a> to Genesis, its parent company Digital Currency Group, and DCG&#8217;s founder Barry Silbert, aggressively accusing them all of fraud. When Silbert&#8217;s companies wouldn&#8217;t agree to a repayment plan they proposed, the twins followed the letters with a lawsuit filed on July 7.</p><p>Now, the Attorney General of New York is entering the fray, saying &#8220;you know what? It <em>does</em> look like they committed fraud. But so did you, Gemini.&#8221; That <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/nysoag-complaint-against-gemini-et-al.pdf">lawsuit</a>, filed October 19, names Gemini, Genesis, and DCG as defendants, as well as the individuals Michael Moro (former CEO of Genesis) and Barry Silbert (CEO and founder of DCG). The Winklevii are not named. According to the NYAG, Gemini knew their exposure to Genesis was high risk, but continued to promote the Gemini Earn lending product to retail customers as a safe way to earn profits on their crypto holdings. According to the NYAG, Gemini at one point revised its internal evaluation of Genesis&#8217; creditworthiness to &#8220;junk grade&#8221;, some of their own risk personnel withdrew their own funds from the Gemini lending program, and one exec compared Genesis&#8217; condition to the Lehman Brothers shortly before its collapse &#8212; but no communication was ever made to customers to inform them that the product had become riskier, nor did Gemini ever really stop working with Genesis (despite gestures at doing so a month or two before Genesis ultimately halted withdrawals). Meanwhile, the NYAG asserts that Genesis failed to adequately vet its borrowers, although they lied to their business partners that they had done so. Furthermore, DCG and Genesis reportedly tried to hide the truth of Genesis&#8217; dire financial condition, including by creating a decade-long, 1% interest, $1.1 billion promissory note between DCG and Genesis and by falsifying financial reports or trying to delay sending them.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>The lawsuit highlights some examples of individuals who were hurt by the companies&#8217; alleged actions:</p><div class="pullquote"><p>One of the Earn investors was Complainant No. 1, a 73-year-old mother, grandmother, and resident of the State of New York. She and her husband, who are both retired, invested their life savings of over $199,000 in Earn because they believed Gemini&#8217;s marketing statements that Gemini was a safe and secure choice. Complainant No. 1 had hoped to use this money to pay for her grandchild&#8217;s education. Outside of her Earn investment, she and her husband have little savings.</p><p>Another Earn investor, Complainant No. 2, is a 56-year-old resident of the State of New York. Complainant No. 2 invested approximately $20,500 in Earn, virtually all his savings. Complainant No. 2 chose Earn because he researched the product and came to believe, based on Gemini&#8217;s statements, that Earn was more secure than other interest-bearing cryptocurrency investments.</p></div><p>The web of litigation grows ever more tangled.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png" width="1456" height="2008" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2008,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:851868,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ff90343-bfdc-4b5c-a2d3-0bbd71010a84_2132x2940.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Everything is perfectly clear now, right?</figcaption></figure></div><h2>In governments and regulators</h2><p>When an <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/136620313/grayscale">appeals court sided with Grayscale</a> in August, finding that the SEC had not &#8220;adequately explain[ed] why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> but not Grayscale&#8217;s proposed bitcoin ETP&#8221; and vacating the Commission&#8217;s order denying their application, the SEC was given 45 days to appeal.

One answer: cryptocurrency.&#8221;</p><p>First of all, it&#8217;s known that Hamas receives funding from state sponsors, making the overdramatic &#8220;One answer: cryptocurrency&#8221; pretty misleading. But more importantly, the report may have been based on shoddy research, with the <em>WSJ&#8217;s</em> sources BitOK and Ellliptic reportedly misidentifying substantial funds as being linked to terrorist entities, <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-terrorism-financing-accuracy-check/">according to Chainalysis</a>. The numbers printed in the <em>WSJ</em> were then cited by Elizabeth Warren and other senators, who <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023.10.17%20Letter%20to%20Treasury%20and%20White%20House%20re%20Hamas%20crypto%20security.pdf">wrote</a> to urge the Treasury to crack down on crypto following attacks by Hamas in Israel.</p><p>Cryptocurrency numbers are regularly overstated in news reports (especially crypto media), and generally to the benefit of the industry. Remember, for example, the sentiment that crypto was somehow unilaterally supporting Ukraine in its resistance against the Russian invasion when in reality, it formed only a small sliver of the mostly fiat-denominated aid that flowed to the country. Now, it&#8217;s a crypto-critical narrative being bolstered by apparently bad numbers, and that&#8217;s disappointing to see if that's indeed what happened.

Bitcoin prices soared by almost $2,000 on the news before dropping right back down when it was revealed that <em>Cointelegraph</em> had been hoodwinked by a faked Bloomberg Terminal screenshot. Almost $100 million in positions were liquidated: mostly Bitcoin shorts that were wiped out by the surge, although some long positions were also taken out by the dip back down when the truth became apparent.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png" width="1456" height="845" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:845,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:241326,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A sudden spike and then rapid decrease in the price of Bitcoin, from just under $28,000 to $30,000 and then back to around $28,000&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="A sudden spike and then rapid decrease in the price of Bitcoin, from just under $28,000 to $30,000 and then back to around $28,000" title="A sudden spike and then rapid decrease in the price of Bitcoin, from just under $28,000 to $30,000 and then back to around $28,000" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea932a-cb78-4685-abf6-a0e51eb5818a_1754x1018.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bitcoin price spike on October 16 (<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=COINBASE%3ABTCUSD">TradingView</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Cointelegraph</em> subsequently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/clarification-sharing-false-spot-bitcoin-etf-news">apologized</a> for their error, blaming a failure in their usual editorial controls.

However, these were limited to only three subreddits: r/CryptoCurrency, whose token was called $MOON; r/FortniteBR, which had a token called $BRICK; and r/EthTrader, which had the $DONUT token.</p><p>Crypto advocates were delighted, largely viewing it as an opportunity to onboard the masses to crypto.</p><p>Now, however, Reddit has pulled the plug on the program. Citing scaling difficulties, regulatory uncertainty, and the amount of resources the company found itself having to put into the feature, they informed holders that their tokens would no longer have any functionality on Reddit.

Instead, they very bluntly addressed the reason: &#8220;It became clear that the crypto industry itself becomes much smaller than its initial ambition (&#8221;the new internet&#8221;) and specialized tools for crypto companies are unlikely to produce venture-scale outcomes.&#8220;</p><h3>An explanation by TrueUSD raises even more concerns</h3><p>[<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=trueusd-teuro-announcement">link</a>]</p><p>Justin Sun project TrueUSD disavowed a new stablecoin that emerged earlier this month, called $TEURO. They claimed to have nothing to do with the project, and chided users to be more skeptical about newly-created tokens.</p><p>However, this explanation raised major concerns among observers who saw that the TEURO token had been deployed by the TrueUSD deployer, which left two possible explanations: TrueUSD was lying about not creating the token, or the TrueUSD deployer had been compromised. Earlier in October, TrueUSD had disclosed a hack, which they said had affected a third-party vendor and had exposed customer information. Following the TEURO disavowal, some worried that perhaps that hack had also resulted in private keys being leaked.</p><h3>Everything else</h3><ul><li><p>AuBit, the company behind Freeway, enters liquidation [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=aubit-liquidation">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>Treasury Department introduces proposal targeting crypto mixers [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=treasury-department-introduces-proposal-targeting-crypto-mixers">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>Gemini, Genesis, and DCG sued over $1 billion alleged fraud [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=gemini-genesis-and-dcg-lawsuit">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>Hope Lend emptied in $825,000 hack [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=hope-lend-hack">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>Everscale halts bridge as "large number" of tokens stolen [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=everscale-hack">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>Fantom Foundation and employees lose collective $7 million in mass hack [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=fantom-wallet-hacks">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>Almost $100 million liquidated over false news of Bitcoin ETF approval [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=fake-etf-approval-news">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>South Korean regulators allege Sui Foundation manipulated markets [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=south-korean-regulators-allege-sui-foundation-manipulated-markets">link</a>]</p></li><li><p>Hackers host malicious code on Binance chain to circumvent takedowns [<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=hackers-host-malicious-code-on-binance-chain-to-circumvent-takedowns">link</a>]</p></li></ul><h2>Worth a read</h2><p><em><strong>404 Media</strong></em>. &#8220;<a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-a-30-million-cash-for-bitcoin-laundering-ring-in-the-heart-of-new-york/">Inside a $30 Million Cash-for-Bitcoin Laundering Ring in the Heart of New York</a>&#8221;.</p><blockquote><p>Media upstart <em>404 Media</em> teamed up with another publication I enjoy, <em><span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Court Watch&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1173094,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;pub&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/seamushughes&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e02fde83-faf4-41fe-84f2-ebb7af13a92d_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;57e207a9-2416-4f61-9cfc-ebdc0b8b63c7&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span></em>, to do a deep dive into the investigation of a criminal organization that converted crypto into cash for criminals who didn&#8217;t want to go through the increasingly-surveilled crypto off-ramps like cryptocurrency exchanges.

He had repeatedly talked about the care FTX took in safeguarding customer funds, something he said he genuinely believed to be true based on the conversations he&#8217;d had with Sam Bankman-Fried. He claimed he only learned about the billions of missing funds on November 7, as the company hurtled towards bankruptcy. He resigned the following day.</p><p>Sun also spoke about how Bankman-Fried invited him on a walk shortly before a call with possible rescue investors, where Bankman-Fried asked him to come up with possible theoretical explanations for how FTX could have lost so much customer money that would still be within the bounds of the law. Sun suggested a few, though he said didn&#8217;t think any of them were supported by the facts. He would later hear Bankman-Fried regurgitate one of those theories, which related to customer-approved borrowing and lending, on <em>Good Morning America</em>.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;18b4c0b6-07ce-44a8-940e-6bc92ae25360&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>(This clip was played for jurors.)</p><p>The defense&#8217;s past claims that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s company-wide message deletion policy was blessed by its lawyers also earned no support from Sun, who said he couldn&#8217;t recall any data retention documentation at all.</p><p>Today&#8217;s witnesses &#8212; Sun, and an investor named Bob Boroujerdi &#8212; were brief and offered no real bombshells, so instead I will be turning to a question I can&#8217;t get out of my head: what the hell is going on with Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53e4a5a5-fed3-4b17-a09b-df60fa5a06c2_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The defense&#8217;s cross-examination on Thursday was similarly haphazard as in past days.</p><p>To be fair, we&#8217;re still the phase of the trial where the prosecution is putting on their case, and so they have the home court advantage. They&#8217;re the ones choosing the witnesses, many of whom they&#8217;ve met with dozens of times over the months since the FTX collapse. They set the order of testimony, and they lead the questioning, so it&#8217;s easier for them to formulate a strong narrative as they incorporate both personal testimony as to what happened and corroborating documentary evidence. They&#8217;ve done a good job: their story that Sam Bankman-Fried knowingly spearheaded a massive fraud, with the help of his several co-conspirators, has been quite convincing. They&#8217;ve even added color around the margins, painting him as an incompetent boss, a bully, and even an abusive boyfriend whose lopsided romance with Caroline Ellison allowed him to manipulate her into playing a major role in the fraud.</p><p>The defense&#8217;s opportunities during cross-examination to introduce doubt into the prosecution&#8217;s story or the credibility of their witnesses, or suggest alternate explanations for what really happened, have seemed few and far between. What opportunities do exist often seem to be squandered, as one of the defense team&#8217;s eight attorneys &#8212; typically Mark Cohen or Christian Everdell &#8212; will regularly pick up a line of questioning only to seem to drop it right as they begin to approach some possible conclusion. One major argument they teased in their open statement &#8212; that Ellison was responsible for the companies&#8217; downfall, not Bankman-Fried &#8212; sputtered out when it came time for them to cross-examine her, and they landed no major blows to her credibility. Repetitive questions have only echoed the direct questioning by the prosecution, adding little new information for juries to incorporate and giving the impression that the defense team is just running out the clock. This behavior more often than not has led to stern rebukes by the judge &#8212; both within and out of earshot of the jury, who are likely looking to the judge for a sort of vibe check on how each team is doing.</p><p>I keep waiting for another shoe to drop, for the defense to pursue a line of argument that makes everything suddenly crystallize, weaving together the scattered threads of questioning they&#8217;ve left strewn on the courtroom floor.</p><p>Maybe it will come next week, as the defense team brings their case &#8212; if they choose to do so. The burden of proof rests with the prosecutors, and there is no obligation for the defense team to prove the innocence of the defendant, so they <em>could</em> choose not to mount a case. That seems pretty unlikely here, though, and would be tantamount to admitting defeat in the face of such a strong case by the government.</p><h3>What&#8217;s the defense&#8217;s case?</h3><p>But assuming they do bring a case, what will it even be? They&#8217;ve hinted at numerous possible arguments: that the blame rests solely with Bankman-Fried&#8217;s co-conspirators, or this was all one big mistake, or the company was &#8220;building the plane in midair&#8221;, or his lawyers told him it was okay, or FTX was operating outside of the US and so all these pesky laws don&#8217;t apply, or his company&#8217;s terms of service allowed him to do whatever he wanted with customer money. The list goes on and on. But none of these arguments has emerged as a frontrunner, and all seem to have been foreseen and preemptively rebutted by the prosecution.</p><p>Perhaps they&#8217;re hoping that this scattershot approach will still be enough to sow sufficient doubt to convince at least one of twelve jurors that the government hasn&#8217;t made its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><h3>Why does the defense seem to be so weak?</h3><p>As I wrack my brain to understand why the defense is playing out this way, a few possibilities come to mind.</p><p>One possibility is that the defense team just&#8230; isn&#8217;t very good. The team, which comes from the relatively distinguished Cohen &amp; Gressler law firm, has a pretty good reputation, but could it be unearned? After all, they didn&#8217;t achieve an acquittal in their most well-known case, either: Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to twenty years. Then again, they faced a near impossible task defending a client with such provably close ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and perhaps getting her a 20-year sentence out of a possible 35 years was the best possible outcome.</p><p>Another possibility &#8212; significantly more likely than the first, in my view &#8212; is that this case is similarly unwinnable. The defense&#8217;s difficulty in conjuring a plausible alternative explanation for how these companies collapsed in which Bankman-Fried emerges innocent could simply be because no such explanation exists. Defense attorneys aren&#8217;t miracle workers, and try as they might, they can&#8217;t always prevent smoking guns from being introduced into evidence (such as <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/ftx-trial-day-seven-sam-i-guess">Ellison&#8217;s contemporaneous admissions implicating Bankman-Fried</a> at a surreptitiously-recorded company meeting).</p><p>One additional factor that may be complicating things is the specific defendant they&#8217;re tasked with trying to exonerate. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s past relationships with lawyers have been troubled, to say the least, with one team throwing in the towel less than two weeks after the company filed for bankruptcy because of his &#8220;incessant and disruptive tweeting&#8221;.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DezodR9hNI&amp;t=894s">interview</a> with Tiffany Fong, who asked what his then-lawyers thought about his public statements, he responded: &#8220;I told them to go fuck themselves. I don&#8217;t think they know what they&#8217;re talking about. I mean, whatever, they know what they&#8217;re talking about in the extremely narrow domain of litigation, they don&#8217;t understand the broader context of the world.&#8221;</p><p>As someone who&#8217;s watched Bankman-Fried rather intently over the last year or so, he&#8217;s always come across to me as someone who is so confident in his own intelligence and abilities that he believes he can outwit anyone. This could potentially include his own lawyers. If his defense team doesn&#8217;t have the full story from him, or if he&#8217;s not being helpful in providing information to formulate his defense, he could be sabotaging his very own strategy. Some obstinance on his part seemed to come through <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1696890831158824972">in August</a> when, despite pleas from his defense team to the judge for more access to their client, Bankman-Fried refused to meet with his own lawyers because the jailhouse Internet was slow and the provided laptop battery was weak.</p><h3>Will Bankman-Fried testify?</h3><p>It seems to me that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s best chance at this point is to keep his mouth shut and hope that the jury &#8212; or at least one single juror &#8212; hasn&#8217;t found the government&#8217;s case to be convincing.</p><p>Putting the sometimes abrasive Bankman-Fried on the witness stand seems like a surefire way to turn the jury against him, and he will face tough questions from the prosecution for which he may not be prepared. His usual approaches of trying to dodge questions he doesn&#8217;t want to answer, or dance around them in long-winded but insubstantial responses, aren&#8217;t likely to hold up well in front of experienced cross-examination under oath, with a prosecution team equipped with an arsenal of evidence to rebut any falsehoods.</p><p>Even if he seems destined for conviction one way or another, he still has much left to lose if he takes the stand: he could still convince the jury to convict him on more charges than they otherwise might have, or cause the judge to impose a longer sentence, or cut off possible avenues for appeal.</p><p>Your average person would probably take their defense counsel&#8217;s advice and clam up. Sam Bankman-Fried is not your average person. The man who seems endlessly confident in his own abilities to talk his way out of trouble, who has spoken of his willingness to take huge risks in the hopes of even a small chance at an outsized reward, is exactly the type of person who might avail himself of the judge&#8217;s offer: if he wants to testify, even if his lawyers have advised him not to, all he has to do is stand up.</p><div

That was, perhaps, the last rational decision he would make for a while.</p><p>Over the following month, he embarked on a vigorous media blitz, talking to just about anyone he could convince to listen. There were a lot of takers. Of course, he appeared for high-profile interviews, such as with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the <em>New York Times&#8217;</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyoGdwVIwWw">Dealbook Summit</a> or with George Stephanopoulos on <em><a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/Business/story/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-denies-improper-customer-funds-94233125">Good Morning America</a></em>, but he would talk to anyone &#8212; hell, he even talked to me.</p><div class="native-audio-embed" data-component-name="AudioPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;label&quot;:null,&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;6fbbfef7-c079-4595-b545-ba246fbf7907&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:13.97551,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><div class="pullquote"><p>Molly White: Are you worried you might be detained if you stepped foot into the US?</p><p>Sam Bankman-Fried: I don&#8217;t believe I would be, but I haven&#8217;t done a &#8212; like &#8212; deep dive into that. At some point, that&#8217;s something I have to think harder about.</p></div><p>(He was arrested hours later.)</p><p>One of the most explosive conversations was one he later said he didn&#8217;t expect would be made public. Kelsey Piper, a <em>Vox</em> journalist who&#8217;d interviewed Bankman-Fried before, decided to take a shot at asking him a few questions. To her surprise, he replied. The following day, she published an article titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy">Sam Bankman-Fried tries to explain himself</a>&#8221;, which largely consisted of screenshots from their chat the previous night.</p><p>Shortly after she published the article, she received more DMs:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6635adeb-ea5e-4daf-a759-0a1711b66b0a_1226x500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6635adeb-ea5e-4daf-a759-0a1711b66b0a_1226x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6635adeb-ea5e-4daf-a759-0a1711b66b0a_1226x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6635adeb-ea5e-4daf-a759-0a1711b66b0a_1226x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6635adeb-ea5e-4daf-a759-0a1711b66b0a_1226x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6635adeb-ea5e-4daf-a759-0a1711b66b0a_1226x500.png" width="1226" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6635adeb-ea5e-4daf-a759-0a1711b66b0a_1226x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:1226,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:96280,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;DMs between Kelsey Piper and SBF.

Awkward.</p><p>The defense&#8217;s rebuttal to this line of testimony &#8212; as well as to later testimony from FBI forensic accountant Paige Owens &#8212; seemed to be that dollars are fungible, and so it was impossible truly to know where a given dollar pooled among other dollars in a bank account went in the end.</p><p>This makes sense in some circumstances. For example, say my mom gave me $5 to spend on lunch at school when I was a kid, and I put it in my pocket with another $5 I&#8217;d earned by doing an odd job for a neighbor. If later came home from school having spent $5 on lunch and $1 on a candy bar, it would be weird for my mom to get mad at me for having spent the money <em>she</em> gave me for lunch on candy.</p><p>The problem is that this argument only works if I already had enough money in my pocket to spend on the other thing. If my pockets were empty and she gave me $5, and I came home hungry and high on sugar because I&#8217;d bought a $1 candy bar but no lunch because I only had $4 left, her anger would be much more justified.</p><p>In Alameda&#8217;s case, it was arguably even worse &#8212; not only were they taking customer and investor money to spend on things other than what they&#8217;d promised, without having sufficient other money in the bank, in many cases they were doing that spending while they also owed money to people. They had <em>negative</em> money in the bank, and they were <em>still</em> blowing money that they shouldn&#8217;t have even been touching on political donations, real estate, or long-term venture investments.</p><p>However, during both Easton&#8217;s testimony and the later testimony of Paige Owens, the defense found some opportunities to introduce some doubt. In Easton&#8217;s testimony they seemed to identify an error in one of his exhibits, where he&#8217;d improperly included some customer deposits kept at FTX in a graph that was only supposed to show Alameda&#8217;s liabilities. They also suggested that his analysis might have been incomplete, as it didn&#8217;t incorporate assets Alameda held on other exchanges, had tied up as collateral for loans, or had put into venture investments. In Owens&#8217; case, they questioned her use of LIFO accounting,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> suggesting that a FIFO<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> approach could produce different results. They also revisited one of her exhibits, showing that she might have missed a deposit that ostensibly could have funded one of the political donations by Ryan Salame, instead of customer funds.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbfa5609-d9eb-4e0e-9337-34e56332160d_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Other witnesses today gave relatively little in the way of testimony, but were used to attest that various documents and recordings were authentic (more on that in a minute). Among them was Eliora Katz, FTX US&#8217;s in-house lobbyist, who was used to introduce to the record written testimony by Bankman-Fried in front of both branches of congress, video clips of his oral testimony to Congress, blog posts about his regulatory recommendations, and various tweets pertaining to crypto regulation (although throughout, she repeatedly emphasized that she did not work at FTX while most of the evidence she testified to was being created).</p><p>One clip seemed to show Bankman-Fried rather blatantly lying under oath to <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408206">Congress in December 2021</a> that there was &#8220;complete transparency&#8221; and a &#8220;robust, consistent risk framework applied&#8221; on FTX:</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;276e6eaa-2ec2-4719-a493-75e308c95189&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>&#8220;We have never had customer losses, clawbacks, or anything like that, even going through periods of large movements in both directions,&#8221; he boasted.</p><p>The prosecution also introduced metadata associated with the various Google Docs and Google Sheets that have been used as evidence throughout their case, which they will presumably use to establish that specific individuals created, edited, or viewed the documents.</p><h3>Behind the scenes</h3><p>We got a real taste of Judge Kaplan&#8217;s frustration on Wednesday, when the Judge instructed both the prosecution and the defense to stay behind during the afternoon break. Several witnesses had been brought in to testify to the authenticity of documents because the two sides couldn&#8217;t agree to stipulate to them. &#8220;Where did he fly in from?&#8221; asked the judge, about a Google records custodian brought to testify about metadata, but was not well versed in interpreting it. &#8220;Texas,&#8221; replied the prosecution. &#8220;This is a joke,&#8221; said the judge. &#8220;We had a witness this morning, who knew absolutely nothing and spent the time saying &#8216;I had nothing to do with any of that&#8217;, read documents that are public records. And this afternoon we fly somebody in from Texas to put in documents about what he knows nothing or next to nothing that are obviously stipulatable. We have 18 people devoting time here to this case and it&#8217;s really a crime, that part of it.&#8220; He concluded, &#8220;Lawyers are supposed to do a little better than this. I am talking to both sides.&#8221;</p><h3>Going forward</h3><p>Tomorrow is the last day in court this week, and it should be a short one. Former FTX attorney Can Sun will testify, as will Third Point managing director Bob Boroujerdi.</p><p>After tomorrow, the next day of trial isn&#8217;t scheduled until the following Thursday, the 26th. I will probably still publish during that break, but with no trial there won&#8217;t be daily coverage like I&#8217;ve been doing.

                <![CDATA[<p>After what has felt like nine days of straight airballs from Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense team, Tuesday I think they might have scored a few points.</p><p>That&#8217;s not to say it was success across the board, though: the cross-examination of FTX engineering director Nishad Singh featured many of the same blunders that have by now come to characterize the defense. The government continued to frequently successfully object to Mark Cohen&#8217;s lines of questioning, and Cohen once again would occasionally misstate past testimony or ask questions that only ended up confusing their target, the judge, and &#8212;&nbsp;most likely &#8212; the jury.</p><p>On Tuesday, an exchange between Cohen and Singh revealed that Cohen didn&#8217;t seem to know what a git commit<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> is, making for an awkward couple of minutes as Singh tried to answer the question precisely while Cohen was really intending to ask something else.</p><p>At one point, Cohen pursued a line of questioning that suggested he had conflated two portions of Singh&#8217;s testimony from Monday. Monday, Singh had testified that he had backdated transactions at Bankman-Fried&#8217;s request to make it appear as though customers had been being charged for Serum staking services throughout the year. This ultimately bumped FTX&#8217;s annual revenue number from slightly under $1 billion to slightly over, which was something Bankman-Fried apparently cared enough about to instruct his employees to falsify transactions and then lie to auditors. Despite this testimony, Cohen tried to get Singh to answer that he had never actually performed the transactions. &#8220;No, I did. I backdated them,&#8221; replied Singh.</p><p>At a different point on Monday, Singh had testified that he did <em>not</em> follow through on backdating falsified transactions that would have shown various insiders transferring their Serum holdings to Alameda Research at an earlier point in time, which he understood would ultimately be used to try to fool the CFTC into believing that Alameda Research had always had more collateral than it had. This is likely what Cohen was thinking of, but by confusing the two, instead of underscoring for the jury that some of the supposed wrongdoing at FTX never happened, he in fact achieved the opposite.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aa63356-39df-4024-9357-77bc2fb5dffc_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Despite the continued whiffs, Cohen managed to weaken Singh&#8217;s testimony from Monday in other ways.</p><p>Cohen began with the same strategy he&#8217;s used on other FTX and Alameda employees who&#8217;ve testified so far, which is to try to suggest that when they evaluated past events, they were doing so without the type of complete knowledge that Bankman-Fried might have had, and therefore couldn&#8217;t properly know if Bankman-Fried was acting wisely. This fell flat with Caroline Ellison, in part because she <em>did</em> have a lot of this knowledge, but also because it at times seemed to contradict the defense&#8217;s story that Ellison was the one in charge, not Bankman-Fried.</p><p>However, with Singh, it worked a little better. Singh had spoken at length during direct on Monday about the &#8220;excess and flashiness&#8221; he felt characterized much of FTX&#8217;s spending, including the purchase of the naming rights to the FTX Arena, or massive payments to influence brokers like Michael Kives.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png" width="1440" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2026938,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6d6d24-4a91-4df8-afed-0e039ef96a16_1440x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">FTX paid $135 million in March 2021 for a 19-year-long deal to obtain the naming rights for the arena used by the Miami Heat.</figcaption></figure></div><p>During cross-examination, Cohen got Singh to equivocate a bit on whether he thought $135 million was truly unreasonable for a 19-year-long deal to acquire arena naming rights. Ultimately, Singh acknowledged that &#8220;it had business benefits and costs&#8221;, which he said were up to Bankman-Fried to weigh. Regarding celebrities and buying connections to celebrities, Singh acknowledged that those connections &#8220;could be valuable for the business &#8230; depending on the circumstances&#8221;.

Later, Singh described the purchase as &#8220;egregious, unnecessary, and selfish&#8221;. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg" width="1456" height="968" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:968,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:389528,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af5bf47-5299-4595-81f0-636c3d8b7584_1600x1064.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Orcas Island, WA (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Orcas_Island_aerial_view_EPA_photo.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>With further questioning, he also spoke regretfully of his own behavior in continuing to donate substantial amounts of money to political causes.</p><p>Right at the beginning of the day, the defense pushed back on statements Singh made the previous day characterizing the penthouse he shared with other employees as ostentatious and far too expensive. Singh had testified that he had expressed these concerns to Bankman-Fried. &#8220;Sam said that he would pay $100 million for the drama to just be done with and go away, which I took as a pretty clear sign that I should shut up and we should move forward with this,&#8221; he&#8217;d said about the conflict over the apartment purchase.</p><p>&#8220;You moved into the apartment?&#8221; asked the defense, which Singh answered affirmatively. &#8220;You and your girlfriend lived in one of the master bedroom suites, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; &#8220;The nicest room in the house,&#8221; answered Singh. Asked if he&#8217;d ever considered moving out, Singh replied, &#8220;I considered moving out many times.&#8221; &#8220;But you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; the defense fired back.</p><p>Perhaps, they seemed to suggest, Singh&#8217;s disgust at FTX&#8217;s and Bankman-Fried&#8217;s spending was all for show, and he too enjoyed the finer things.</p><p>Cohen made a similar point elsewhere, seemingly trying to undermine Singh&#8217;s self-professed effective altruism, and his belief that money is better spent on charitable giving rather than enriching one&#8217;s own life. Cohen revisited a $477 million loan made from FTX to Singh in late 2021, which was really Singh trying to exercise stock options he&#8217;d been granted.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><blockquote><p>Cohen: One of the reasons you were looking to do this was you wanted to donate the money to charity.</p><p>Singh: Right.</p><p>Cohen: Did you end up doing that?</p><p>Singh: No.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond the topics of extravagant spending, Cohen also successfully seeded some doubt in Singh&#8217;s recounting of various events. First, Singh was asked to repeat the timeline of events surrounding the discovery of the bug that led the balance of funds owed by Alameda to FTX to be overstated by roughly $8 billion, which he did. &#8220;Do you believe you are clear on the sequence of what happened?&#8221; asked Cohen. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I remember everything about it,&#8221; Singh replied, but he said that he was recounting the events as best he could. Then, however, Cohen called back to testimony Singh gave to prosecutors back in January, where he reportedly told them he &#8220;had a surprising amount of haziness when trying to recall events in June and July of 2022.&#8221; Singh affirmed, &#8220;there was a lot that I &#8212; there was a lot that I didn't remember the details around from that time.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7b3021-82ed-4f96-a13e-980f814844e8_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>One portion of the questioning around the penthouse in The Bahamas, though, fell very flat for me.

Sort of like Lucille Bluth and the ten dollar banana but in reverse, I couldn&#8217;t tell you if your average billionaire spends $1 million or $10 million or $100 million on a home, because I don&#8217;t know any billionaires and those numbers are so far away from my own net worth that I couldn&#8217;t even hazard a guess.</p><div id="youtube2-Nl_Qyk9DSUw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Nl_Qyk9DSUw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nl_Qyk9DSUw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>But secondly, it seemed to me that the defense should have chosen <em>either</em> to downplay the $30 million apartment, <em>or</em> argue that Singh had spent selfishly and extravagantly on a home that cost eight times less.

If they&#8217;re lucky, hours of sitting in the juror booth, punctuated by several breaks, obscured the contradiction.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b269581-3f43-4791-afd1-db992f8f3e78_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The prosecution wrapped up with a quick redirect examination, in which they asked Singh to affirm that he had never reviewed the transcripts of his conversations with prosecutors, presumably to introduce some doubt as to whether the conversations Cohen had him revisit were faithfully documented.</p><p>As for the Orcas Island property, the prosecution asked him what happened to it. &#8220;I forfeited it,&#8221; he replied, saying that he was &#8220;embarrassed and ashamed&#8221; to have bought it, and thought forfeiting the property might be a small way to right that wrong.</p><p>The prosecution ended by asking why Singh thought about resigning in September 2022, which he answered in the same fiery words that he used throughout his questioning on Monday: &#8220;I knew that I was becoming party and participating in something heinously criminal; that to keep running the business without divulging to others that there was a hole, I would be betraying customers that deposited their money into the hole, betraying my other employees. The scale of wrongdoing was enormous.&#8220;</p><h3>A juicy detail</h3><p>Intermingled with Singh&#8217;s answers to the defense&#8217;s questions was one juicy detail. When speaking about the $477 million loan in late 2021, Singh told Cohen that he&#8217;d consulted with several lawyers about its structure. Cohen asked who they were, and Singh replied: &#8220;Can Sun; Joe Bankman; two of Sam's personal tax lawyers, David Forst, Sean McElroy, and others.&#8221; Joe Bankman is Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s father, a Stanford tax law professor, who appears to have been far more involved in some of the goings-on at FTX and Alameda than either he or his son would like to admit. Can Sun is set to testify later this week.</p><h3>Meetings in New York</h3><p>The last witness of the day was FBI agent Richard Busick, who testified about his analysis of cell phone records tied to a phone number used by Bankman-Fried. Much of this was very dry, with detailed explanations of what that analysis entails and what it can and cannot determine. It&#8217;s most likely being used by the prosecution to establish venue for the case by proving that Bankman-Fried was in Manhattan at various points throughout the time period of the fraud they are alleging.</p><p>One interesting detail was how the prosecution established that the phone number provided to the agent for analysis actually belonged to Bankman-Fried: they produced an email sent by a Gmail account with a handle including &#8220;pdavis&#8221;. In the email sent from his personal account, Philip Davis &#8212; the Prime Minister of The Bahamas &#8212; wrote to ask Bankman-Fried if he would speak with his son Christopher, who was working as a consultant for an NFT company that was considering using FTX. It was already known that Bankman-Fried enjoyed a friendly relationship with Bahamian government and regulators, but this was downright cozy.

                <![CDATA[<p>If I&#8217;m being honest, I came away from Monday&#8217;s testimony feeling a little sorry for Nishad Singh despite everything. Maybe I&#8217;m softhearted, or just gullible. But if the jury felt similarly, that&#8217;s <em>very</em> bad news for Sam Bankman-Fried, who once again came off as the villain. Then again, after the third strong testimony from a co-conspirator who unequivocally implicates Bankman-Fried in orchestrating the fraud at FTX, it may not matter much how the jury feels about Singh.</p><p>Singh was FTX&#8217;s director of engineering, a role he took after first working as a software engineer at Alameda Research, and then at FTX. He and Bankman-Fried went way back: they attended the same high school, and Singh was friends with Bankman-Fried&#8217;s younger brother, Gabe. Singh met Sam in his sophomore or junior year, and stated that he had always found him intimidating. &#8220;Sam is a formidable character, brilliant, so I had a lot of admiration and respect for him. Over time I think a lot of that eroded, and I grew distrustful,&#8220; he testified. Singh has pleaded guilty to six charges: the same sorts of conspiracy charges as Ellison and Wang, but also a charge of conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Support more coverage like this by subscribing now, or <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/pay-what-you-want">pick a custom subscription tier</a>.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>Singh, like Bankman-Fried and many others at FTX and Alameda Research, was an adherent to the effective altruism philosophy, but sometimes butted heads with Bankman-Fried over actions he didn&#8217;t feel were aligned with effective altruist goals. He frequently complained to Bankman-Fried about what he perceived as excessive spending, testifying that he &#8220;felt kind of embarrassed and ashamed of how &#8212; how much it all reeked of excess and flashiness. It didn&#8217;t align with what I thought we were building a company for.&#8220; At one point, Bankman-Fried humiliated Singh by accusing him in front of others of &#8220;sowing seeds of doubt in the company decisions&#8221;, saying that people like Singh were &#8220;the real insidious problem here.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2678bd-d3b0-4ac4-955f-3a42e4304fb5_1251x927.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2678bd-d3b0-4ac4-955f-3a42e4304fb5_1251x927.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2678bd-d3b0-4ac4-955f-3a42e4304fb5_1251x927.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2678bd-d3b0-4ac4-955f-3a42e4304fb5_1251x927.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2678bd-d3b0-4ac4-955f-3a42e4304fb5_1251x927.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2678bd-d3b0-4ac4-955f-3a42e4304fb5_1251x927.png" width="1251" height="927" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e2678bd-d3b0-4ac4-955f-3a42e4304fb5_1251x927.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:927,&quot;width&quot;:1251,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1677345,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;An Instagram post by Katy Perry, showing eight people posing for a photograph at the Super Bowl.

That document was, ultimately, how Singh learned in September 2022 that Alameda Research had taken billions of dollars of customer funds from FTX. Although Bankman-Fried had not originally shared the document with Alameda Research&#8217;s CEO, Caroline Ellison, Singh decided to speak with her about the plan&#8217;s viability in a group chat that also contained Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang.</p><blockquote><p>Assistant US Attorney: So how did Caroline Ellison respond to your message?</p><p>Nishad Singh: She said &#8212; and I believe verbatim &#8212; "That's impossible."</p><p>AUSA: How did you respond to that?</p><p>Singh: I said:  Which part of it?

And I was hoping it wasn't the part about closing out accounts.</p><p>AUSA: What did she say?</p><p>Singh: That it was the part about closing out accounts.</p></blockquote><p>This was when Gary Wang told Singh that Alameda was borrowing massive amounts of customer money from FTX &#8212;&nbsp;at the time, around $13 billion of it. Singh testified that he felt &#8220;really afraid&#8221;, and called an in-person meeting immediately. Bankman-Fried, who was sitting next to Singh at the time, &#8220;seemed unsurprised and made up what I understood to be a false excuse for dodging the meeting.&#8221; Singh, Ellison, and Wang met without him, and Singh confirmed his fears: that he had not misunderstood Wang, and that Alameda had actually taken customer funds to that extent.</p><p>At that point, Singh testified that he asked Bankman-Fried to meet one-on-one. The two spoke on the balcony of their shared luxury penthouse, a location Singh chose for privacy.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png" width="1456" height="1125" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1125,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3068083,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A luxurious penthouse balcony in the Albany resort in The Bahamas, Government Exhibit 1554&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="A luxurious penthouse balcony in the Albany resort in The Bahamas, Government Exhibit 1554" title="A luxurious penthouse balcony in the Albany resort in The Bahamas, Government Exhibit 1554" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5e65758-589a-410d-9c1d-d7c51e2201af_1584x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The perfect spot to confront your boss about billions of dollars in missing funds</figcaption></figure></div><p>Singh confronted him about the misappropriated funds, and described a remarkable conversation in which Bankman-Fried said something like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what there is to worry about.&#8221; When Singh mentioned the missing billions, Bankman-Fried said, &#8220;Right, that. We are a little short on deliverable&#8221;. At that point, Bankman-Fried outlined plans to repay the funds by raising money from investors, rolling out futures trading in the US, and &#8212; at Singh&#8217;s prodding &#8212; reducing their extravagant spending.</p><p>In a rather dramatic portion of his testimony, Singh described how he felt: &#8220;I was blindsided and horrified. I felt really betrayed, that five years of blood, sweat, and tears from me and so many employees, driving towards something that I thought was a beautiful force for good, had turned out to be so evil.&#8221;</p><p>He thought about leaving the company then, he testified, but worried that his departure could cause everything to fall apart. He felt that if he stayed, maybe he could help the companies make back what they owed.</p><p>According to Singh, over the next few months he ran up against Bankman-Fried multiple times in trying to make progress towards that goal. At one point, during a private conversation in Bankman-Fried&#8217;s other apartment<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>, Singh tried to raise concerns that a planned investment by Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> would not be sufficient to close the hole in the companies&#8217; finances. Bankman-Fried first told Singh how he was crucial to making FTX successful, allowing them to repay the funds. However, Singh described the overall tenor of the meeting: &#8220;Sam was on edge, and I felt he was very mad at me for talking about this, and it was tense. There were long periods of silence. Sam has a &#8212;&nbsp;some physical twitches for when he gets angry. &#8230; I ended up apologizing to him at the end for asking for the meeting because I could tell it was so unwelcome.&#8221;</p><p>At other points, Singh tried to hold Bankman-Fried to account on his promises that FTX would curtail the spending that Singh already felt was inappropriate, but now he was concerned was digging only a deeper hole in the company finances. He described that Bankman-Fried either downplayed his concerns, or steamrolled them. &#8220;We&#8217;re going ahead with this,&#8221; he said in one instance.</p><p>Shortly after Singh discovered the misappropriation of customer funds, Bankman-Fried asked him to help cover it up, he testified. Bankman-Fried asked Singh to transfer Serum tokens<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> belonging to himself, Singh, Wang, and Ellison into Alameda&#8217;s account, backdating the transfers so that the transactions appeared to have happened much earlier, and updating his collateral calculations to not account for the fact that the Serum tokens were locked and thus couldn&#8217;t be sold. &#8220;I understood the purpose to be to fool the eventual recipient of this &#8212; this, like, data that I was collecting, which was the CFTC.&#8221; Singh stated that he never did the transactions because he wasn&#8217;t comfortable trying to fool a US regulator.</p><p>When customers began withdrawing their funds all at once, Singh was a part of the &#8220;war room&#8221; that tried to handle the crisis. However, he claims that at times he was uncomfortable with what was happening, but felt he had no control to intervene. While Bankman-Fried and others were drafting Bankman-Fried&#8217;s tweet to try to reassure customers &#8212; the one where he wrote that &#8220;FTX is fine. Assets are fine.&#8221; &#8212;  Singh testified that he announced he was &#8220;recusing&#8221; himself from the conversation because he was uncomfortable with what was being proposed. &#8220;I mostly wanted to express that I didn&#8217;t approve of this and &#8212; but I didn&#8217;t &#8212; I acknowledged I didn&#8217;t have the power to stop them. I&#8217;d already made clear my preferences on what to say and so I just didn&#8217;t want to be involved. &#8230; It was really dishonest.&#8220;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facea9f11-59ab-447f-a99a-f7f84385ef80_1086x1460.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facea9f11-59ab-447f-a99a-f7f84385ef80_1086x1460.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facea9f11-59ab-447f-a99a-f7f84385ef80_1086x1460.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facea9f11-59ab-447f-a99a-f7f84385ef80_1086x1460.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facea9f11-59ab-447f-a99a-f7f84385ef80_1086x1460.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facea9f11-59ab-447f-a99a-f7f84385ef80_1086x1460.webp" width="496" height="666.8139963167588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/acea9f11-59ab-447f-a99a-f7f84385ef80_1086x1460.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1460,&quot;width&quot;:1086,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:496,&quot;bytes&quot;:71732,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Two tweets by SBF: 1) A competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors.

He described panicking and asking if he could backdate falsified transactions that would make it appear within company records as though he had paid off all the loans that were in his name. Bankman-Fried approved, writing, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s probably fine&#8221;. However, Singh never went through with it. He testified, &#8220;It felt wrong. I was not &#8212; not to make an excuse for my having proposed this, not at all, but I was in different levels of having a right mind throughout these days, and in better moments, I didn&#8217;t pursue it.&#8221; He stated that by November 8, he&#8217;d &#8220;been suicidal for some days.&#8221;</p><p>Despite Singh&#8217;s testimony that he didn&#8217;t know about the billions in misappropriated customer funds until September 2022, he wasn&#8217;t exactly squeaky clean up until that point either. How much of it was due to na&#239;vet&#233; and how much was willful criminal activity is, I suppose, a question for the judge to answer in sentencing.</p><p>For example, Singh routinely rubber-stamped donations made in his name to causes and political candidates he had never even heard about, &#8220;for advantageous optics&#8221;. As stated by Michael Sadowsky, a partner of Gabe Bankman-Fried&#8217;s at his Guarding Against Pandemics political action committee, Singh had been designated &#8220;the center-left face of our spending&#8220; which meant he would be &#8220;giving to a lot of woke shit for transactional purposes.&#8221; Although Singh testified that he felt uncomfortable with the straw donations, and wanted to find another employee willing to take his place, it seems like that never happened.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749721-5654-4e9e-96b8-567efffd6d56_2916x2099.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749721-5654-4e9e-96b8-567efffd6d56_2916x2099.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749721-5654-4e9e-96b8-567efffd6d56_2916x2099.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749721-5654-4e9e-96b8-567efffd6d56_2916x2099.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749721-5654-4e9e-96b8-567efffd6d56_2916x2099.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749721-5654-4e9e-96b8-567efffd6d56_2916x2099.png" width="1200" height="863.7362637362637" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb749721-5654-4e9e-96b8-567efffd6d56_2916x2099.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1048,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:3394609,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Signal chat with Michael Sadowsky Member of Donation Processing, The Six Fantastic Five, and 4 additional groups Jul 5, 2022  Nishad Singh: in general I'm averse to ~explicitly-woke stuff, but if if it's especially good or if it's hard to interact productively with democrats without that, I understqand but that's mostly besides the point, the specifics of this case are what matter more :) anyway, what's up with the LGBT victory fund?  1:30 PM Michael Sadowsky: this is just giving BB superPAC $, but we should chat broadly on this this specific case is a passthrough to run ads in favor of Becca Ballint  MS: she's been good on pandemics; put stuff on her website Molly Gray said she wouldn't do anything on it the winner here is favored to be the next senator of VT once someone retires this is both to help BB win, and to get on her good side  NS: ah makes sense, got it  MS:we are not doing it ourselves, because Gray got her to commit to denouncing super PAC spend at a debate so we would take a negative press hit but, in general, you being the center left face of our spending will mean you giving to a lot of woke shit for transcational purposes so, if you're not comfortable about it, you should think about that a lot *you should think about how comfortable you're going to be with it  Quoted message by MS: so, if you're not comfortable about it, you should think about that a lot NS: yeah, I think I need to do some of this, and prob see if there are other viable people at FTX for it  MS: cool; but you're ok for now?

On this, he testified that lawyers would &#8220;paper up [the] transaction&#8221;, so it is possible that at the time he believed this was above board, although he didn&#8217;t go into detail on that.</p><h3>The FTX customer</h3><p>Prior to Singh&#8217;s testimony, another former FTX customer was called as a witness. Tareq Morad, a Canadian hotel owner, had deposited around US$500,000 into FTX by wire transfer in April 2021. By the time of FTX&#8217;s collapse, the assets in his account were, if estimated in US dollar value, a little under $260,000. He was never able to withdraw any of them. Placated by Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s &#8220;FTX is fine&#8221; tweet, he didn&#8217;t try to withdraw any funds until the next day, by which point it was too late.</p><h3>Behind the scenes</h3><p>While lawyers on both sides and the judge had expressed their hopes last week that the plan to provide Bankman-Fried with an extended-release dose of Adderall would solve his ongoing medication access issues (see background from <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-frieds-jail-conditions">early September</a> and then <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137957108/behind-the-scenes">last week</a>), that never happened.</p><p>At the beginning of the day, the judge himself stepped in to try to help Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense team get in contact with the proper person at MDC Brooklyn.</p><p>By the end of the day, the judge had learned that the soonest the extended-release medication could be available would be Thursday. The defense asked to adjourn until the medication could be provided, which the judge declined. He explained: &#8220;I have not observed a problem with the defendant in this period of time.  Not that I'm medically competent, but I just make that note. &#8230; The bottom line here is that I have no competent medical evidence that is short of months old. &#8230; I don't even have a medical opinion that he needs it now, or what the effect of not taking it is, and we're going to proceed.&#8220; He noted that the defense could have provided that medical evidence, and had not done so.</p><p>The government&#8217;s attorneys noted that physicians at the Bureau of Prisons had evaluated Bankman-Fried and determined that a lower dosage was appropriate for him;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> they also noted testimony from various witnesses that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s original doctor in The Bahamas &#8220;was liberally prescribing Adderall to people who told us that they did not need Adderall at all or at that level.&#8221;</p><p>The judge, perhaps a bit exasperated, explained that he was not qualified to make medical decisions, nor was it within his power to authorize Marshals to provide Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys with medications to dispense to their client at lunchtime, as they had requested. He dismissed the two teams, presumably to try to find some physicians to back up what they each had to say. And with that, the trial will continue on schedule.</p><p>Tomorrow will bring the cross-examination of Nishad Singh.

                <![CDATA[<p>It was a short day in court on Friday, and not a terribly exciting one. The day was spent questioning and cross-examining Zac Prince, the CEO of BlockFi, who was briefly introduced on Thursday. BlockFi had loaned money to Alameda Research, but was also a customer on FTX. Prince mostly testified about the former, helping the government make their case that Bankman-Fried is guilty of the charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud on Alameda Research lenders.</p><p>BlockFi was a crypto lending firm that &#8212; before everything went pear-shaped &#8212; offered lending services both to individual retail customers and to institutional borrowers like Alameda Research. Individuals could borrow cash against their crypto holdings, or earn interest on them by lending them to BlockFi, who in turn lent those funds to their own borrowers. </p><p>BlockFi had a very bumpy 2022. In May 2022, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital imploded and defaulted on some loans they&#8217;d taken from BlockFi. In June, two other lenders called Voyager and Celsius blew up, sparking a panic in crypto lending in general. BlockFi experienced record high withdrawal rates as customers decided to take their crypto back into their own hands, lest they end up waiting in line to receive some fraction of their assets as had the customers of Voyager and Celsius. By late June, BlockFi needed capital, so they entered into an agreement with FTX&#8217;s US entity in which FTX extended $400 million in credit to BlockFi, with an agreement that FTX could acquire BlockFi starting as soon as July 2023. Prince believed that as soon as that date was reached, FTX would complete the acquisition.</p><p>Needless to say, that never happened.</p><p>When FTX collapsed, BlockFi found themselves over $1 billion in the hole. $650 million in loans were still outstanding to Alameda Research, who couldn&#8217;t repay them, and the company had an additional $350 million of customer funds or loan collateral stuck on the exchange. BlockFi filed for bankruptcy within weeks of FTX.</p><p>Prince testified to all of this on Friday, and outlined the details of how BlockFi evaluated whether to lend to a given institution. The company would review the financial records of a prospective borrower and evaluate the likelihood the company could repay the loans it was requesting. Alameda Research never provided BlockFi with audited financial statements, testified Prince, but that was the norm for BlockFi&#8217;s crypto customers &#8212; &#8220;because of issues with getting audits as a cryptocurrency firm&#8221;, he reasoned.</p><p>&#8220;We always relied on the information that we were given by counterparties as being truthful and accurate,&#8221; said Prince. That was ultimately their downfall. The statements provided by Alameda didn&#8217;t disclose the true extent of the firm&#8217;s liabilities, nor the existence of substantial loans from Alameda to FTX and company executives. All of those things would have led to concerns on BlockFi&#8217;s end, said Prince, depending on the amounts and the details of the transactions involved. Prince testified that if the true extent of liabilities and the outstanding loans had been disclosed, &#8220;we probably wouldn&#8217;t have lent to them at all&#8221; due to concerns that the firm might be insolvent.</p><p>Regarding the loans to executives, it &#8220;would have given us a lot of pause at a much smaller dollar number because it's just a really hard thing to explain a good reason for that to happen.&#8220; Similarly, said Prince, if they had known that Alameda was trading with FTX customer funds, &#8220;I think we wouldn't have worked with them because that's not something that's appropriate.&#8220;</p><p>When things started to go bad at FTX, Bankman-Fried and Ellison tried to convince BlockFi not to recall their loans. Ultimately, Alameda put up more collateral to shore up those loans, in the form of pledged shares in Robinhood<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Unfortunately for BlockFi, the ownership of this collateral was foggy, and there&#8217;s been dispute ever since over whether they belong to the FTX estate, Sam Bankman-Fried personally, or the BlockFi estate.</p><p>At one point, the defense team seemed to hope they could get Prince to implicate Caroline Ellison &#8212; and Ellison alone &#8212;&nbsp;in negotiating that deal: &#8220;[Posting additional collateral] was being done by Caroline Ellison as CEO of Alameda at the time?&#8221; asked defense attorney Mark Cohen. &#8220;My understanding was that it was, you know, Caroline who signed the doc but at Sam's instruction, so I was messaging and emailing with Sam at the time.&#8220; The defense quickly moved on. The defense&#8217;s position that Ellison was solely in control of Alameda, with Bankman-Fried having no insight or control over what happens there, seems to be crumbling by the day.</p><p>In addition to being one of Alameda Research&#8217;s lenders, BlockFi was an FTX customer. They routinely stored the collateral they had received for loans on FTX, and they also stored customer funds on FTX. Prince testified that he believed FTX would never lend out these funds.</p><h3>Behind the scenes</h3><p>As observers question what, if <em>any</em>, strategy the defense team is trying to take, some motion activity behind the scenes has revealed one possible line of attack. A <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631292/321/united-states-v-bankman-fried/">document</a> filed on October 12 seeks permission to pursue the argument that the government&#8217;s &#8220;misappropriation theory&#8221; of fraud on FTX customers is flawed. Although several customers have testified that they didn&#8217;t agree to their assets being moved off the exchange and used by Alameda Research for trading, the defense seems to be pursuing the argument that the specific terms and conditions may have technically allowed FTX to do so.</p><p>Besides that, Bankman-Fried is still having trouble getting the Adderall he is prescribed for his ADHD, say his lawyers. He&#8217;s supposed to get four doses a day, and they last around three hours. This means that the dose he receives at 4 am, when he&#8217;s awoken to go to court to meet with his legal team, has largely worn off by the time they meet around 7, and he doesn&#8217;t get another dose until he&#8217;s returned to jail &#8212; which is sometimes as late as 9 pm. The Bureau of Prisons apparently won&#8217;t allow his midday doses &#8212; which they consider a narcotic substance &#8212; to be transported by Marshals and provided to Bankman-Fried, so he&#8217;s been going without. The defense and prosecution have both apparently been trying to get the BOP to address the issue, which they hope will be solved by Monday by putting Bankman-Fried on an extended-release dose of the medication (which he has consented to). Both legal teams seem to be working hard to resolve this, which Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers acknowledged. The prosecution is likely concerned that a medication issue affecting his focus could raise appellate issues.</p><h3>Going forward</h3><p>If timing allows, next week will likely bring the the testimony of the following witnesses:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Elan Dekel</strong> will testify as a customer of FTX. He is also the vice president of an AI company called Pinecone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Richard Busick</strong> is a special agent with the FBI. He&#8217;s a cell site analyst, meaning he analyzes records from mobile phone networks to establish a device&#8217;s geographical location. The prosecution will be bringing him to establish that Bankman-Fried was in New York at various points in time, helping them establish venue for the case.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137602559/nishad-singh">Nishad Singh</a></strong> was FTX&#8217;s director of engineering. He has pleaded guilty to six charges, including the same types of fraud and money laundering charges facing his co-conspirators, but also a campaign finance charge pertaining to straw donations allegedly made on Bankman-Fried&#8217;s behalf. Singh personally wrote some of the <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/the-fraud-was-in-the-code">code we saw in evidence</a> last week during Gary Wang&#8217;s testimony.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ramnik Arora</strong> was FTX&#8217;s head of product, although his title didn&#8217;t really match his job description. He mostly led up FTX&#8217;s venture investing, and was involved with the BlockFi bailout deal in mid-2022. He was also a member of the &#8220;small group chat&#8221; that has popped up a few times in government exhibits, the Signal war room in which insiders tried to stop the FTX implosion. He has not been charged with any crimes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delaney Ornelas</strong> has been identified by the prosecution as an Alameda Research employee who was &#8220;involved in banking&#8221;. However, the makeshift org chart published by Michael Lewis, which was apparently pieced together by on-site therapist and &#8220;performance coach&#8221; George Lerner, listed her as in charge of human resources at FTX US.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Tareq Morad</strong> was a customer of FTX.</p></li></ul><p>The prosecution estimated that &#8220;the vast majority&#8221; of their case should wrap up next week, though it might spill one day into the next. The trial schedule is about to get a little weird here: court is in session Monday through Thursday next week (October 16&#8211;19), but then won&#8217;t meet again until Thursday and Friday of the subsequent week (October 26 and 27). This means that the defense case may begin as soon as the afternoon of Thursday, October 26.</p><p><em>Social image derived from <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/13/sbf-trial-crypto-lender-blockfi-believed-alameda-was-solvent-given-balance-sheet-it-was-shown-ceo-testifies/">CoinDesk image</a>.</em></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Robinhood is a trading app on which customers can trade traditional stocks, as well as cryptocurrencies.</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>I am about as shocked to learn that there was <em>anyone</em> working in human resources at FTX <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1712668779912565060">as I was to discover</a> that they apparently (at least briefly) had accountants.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>I was bracing myself to read the transcript of today&#8217;s cross-examination of Caroline Ellison, because I expected it to be brutal.</p><p>After her two-day-long testimony for the prosecution, she painted a clear picture: she was guilty of committing fraud by taking FTX&#8217;s customers&#8217; funds to use for Alamada&#8217;s own purposes, and she had done it with Sam Bankman-Fried, and at his explicit direction. It felt pretty damning.</p><p>It was going to be challenging for the defense to discredit this , and I was expecting them to play a little dirty in trying to impeach her credibility: for example, by suggesting to the jury that she was a drug user and therefore untrustworthy,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> or by playing to the jurors&#8217; possible biases around her admittedly unusual relationship with Bankman-Fried. Perhaps this was unfair of me to project on the defense team, but after seeing far too many articles devoted not to the question of whether Ellison was responsible for the theft of customer funds but rather to salacious topics like whether her romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried was part of a larger polycule, it just seemed like the expected behavior.</p><p>Either way, I was surprised when the defense barely cross-examined Ellison at all. That&#8217;s not to say it was brief &#8212; it took much of the day &#8212; but it wasn&#8217;t terribly substantive. As has become a pattern with this defense team, much of the time was spent repeating questions the prosecution had already asked during direct, much to the perturbation of Judge Kaplan, who continued to show occasional moments of annoyance with the defense team. Much of the questioning felt messy, with Mark Cohen occasionally confusing Ellison, the judge, or both. Sometimes he had to back up and restate questions, or have the court reporter restate them for him. Occasionally he interrupted Ellison before she finished speaking, and several times, he misstated her testimony from the previous days, requiring Ellison to clarify that she had not actually said what he claimed she had.</p><p>The picture that I <em>think</em> the defense was trying to paint is this: Ellison was solely in charge of Alameda Research. After her romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried ended in the spring of 2022, her heartbreak got in the way of their communications regarding the business. There was a rivalry between Ellison and Modulo Capital, a trading firm co-founded by another ex-girlfriend of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s, in which Bankman-Fried had invested $400 million against Ellison&#8217;s wishes. Maybe she was incompetent, maybe she was spiteful; either way, as the defense tells it, she ran the firm into the ground all on her own.</p><p>The problem is that I&#8217;m not sure this point was made terribly effectively. While Ellison acknowledged that the breakup affected her ability to communicate with Bankman-Fried, and led her to avoid in-person one-on-one meetings or social events with him, she testified that she still communicated with him about work matters over messaging applications and in group meetings. When asked if they &#8220;weren&#8217;t talking outside of work&#8221;, she said they did sometimes talk &#8212; after all, they lived in the same apartment. &#8220;You were only talking inside of work when you needed to?&#8221; asked the defense. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I would say that,&#8221; replied Ellison.</p><p>Besides that, the defense&#8217;s argument seems to hinge on the allegation that Ellison was bad at trading, or at hedging trades, which is not really what is being considered here. Being a bad trader isn&#8217;t a crime. Losing all of the money you have available to trade &#8212; even when it comes from outside investors &#8212; also isn&#8217;t necessarily a crime. But taking customer funds from your sister cryptocurrency exchange, which was not supposed to be lending them out for trading purposes, and then using them to trade? That&#8217;s a crime, regardless of how well the trading goes, or how many hedges you put in place. And the defense hasn&#8217;t done much to establish that it was Ellison rather than Bankman-Fried who directed that to happen. In fact, the defense was the one who asked her if she ever thought of resigning over her concerns regarding Alameda&#8217;s use of FTX customer funds, which she said she had.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F570e1bcb-6373-44aa-9781-94d0b012808b_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>With Ellison&#8217;s testimony complete, the prosecution called former Alameda Research software developer Christian Drappi to the stand to testify. He has not been charged with any crimes pertaining to the FTX collapse, nor does he seem to be testifying with an immunity grant as was Adam Yedidia.</p><p>Drappi&#8217;s testimony was stunning &#8212; not so much because of anything he said, but because of the evidence he brought with him.</p><p>Three days before the FTX collapse, some poor sap started working at Alameda Research. When the collapse was underway, and Binance announced on Twitter it intended to acquire FTX, Ellison admitted to several shellshocked Alameda traders that the firm had been dipping into FTX customer funds, which it now couldn&#8217;t repay. I assume the new employee&#8217;s survival instincts kicked in at this point, because the next day he surreptitiously recorded an Alameda Research all-hands meeting in which Ellison made further admissions and directly implicated Bankman-Fried. He sent that recording to Drappi, and Drappi provided it to the prosecution.</p><p>Ellison slouched in a beanbag chair, looking &#8220;sunken&#8221;, as she addressed a room of around 15 employees, plus another 10 or 15 who dialed in remotely. She laid out what she called the &#8220;basic story&#8221;:</p><div class="native-audio-embed" data-component-name="AudioPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;label&quot;:null,&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;8bac43bf-21b9-46e4-bd7a-67f1b6e9ce9a&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:61.910206,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><div class="pullquote"><p>Ellison: I mean, the basic story here is that starting last year, Alameda was kind of borrowing a bunch of money via open-term loans and use that to make various illiquid investments. So, like, a bunch of FTX and FTX US equity. A bunch of like other ventures, investments, et cetera. Then with crypto being down, the crash, the &#8212; like, credit crunch this year, most of Alameda's loans got called. And in order to, like, meet those loan recalls, we ended up like borrowing a bunch of funds on FTX which led to FTX having a shortfall in user funds. And so, with the &#8212; once there started being, like FUD about this and users started withdrawing funds, they kind of eventually were realizing that they were unable to &#8212; not going to be able to meet, like, the continued withdrawal pressure.</p></div><p>Several employees asked her questions throughout the meeting, including Drappi. At one point, Ellison is heard giggling on the tape. &#8220;Did Ms. Ellison appear to be having a good time at the meeting, based on your observation?&#8220; asked the prosecution. Drappi replied, &#8220;No. I would characterize that as nervous laughter.&#8221; He elaborated that, over the eighteen months he&#8217;d known Ellison, nervous laughter was a frequent habit of hers.</p><p>Later in the meeting, Drappi asked, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure this wasn&#8217;t like a YOLO thing?&#8221; After explaining to the jury what &#8220;YOLO&#8221; means, and clarifying that he intended to inquire as to whether the decision to use customer deposits to pay off Alameda&#8217;s debts was spontaneous or premeditated, another recording was played. She answered, indicating that it was premeditated.</p><div class="native-audio-embed" data-component-name="AudioPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;label&quot;:null,&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;9cc708fd-f9c3-4819-8492-78f50db27527&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:14.785306,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><div class="pullquote"><p>Drappi: I'm sure, like, this wasn't just like a YOLO thing, right?  Like, you know &#8212;</p><p>Ellison: Yeah, I mean, I guess I talked about it with, like, Sam, Nishad, and Gary, I think.</p></div><p>Finally, a different employee asked, &#8220;Who made the decision on using user deposits?&#8221; Ellison replied, &#8220;Um&#8230; Sam, I guess.&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><div class="native-audio-embed" data-component-name="AudioPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;label&quot;:null,&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;b65e96d1-ab71-4280-bc4e-c4b425e38005&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:15.124898,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><div class="pullquote"><p>Employee: Who made the decision on using user deposits?</p><p>Ellison: Um...Sam, I guess. [nervous laughter]</p></div><p>The existence of this recording, and the ability of the prosecution to introduce it into evidence, seems like <em>terrible</em> news for the defense. Here&#8217;s Ellison, on tape but without the knowledge she was being recorded, saying the exact same things she&#8217;s been saying on the witness stand, implicating Bankman-Fried, but far before any charges were ever filed and any guilty plea was signed. If she&#8217;s only saying things the government has coached her to say, as the defense has been insinuating, why is it that they just so happen to match her contemporaneous statements from November 2022?</p><p>The best the defense seemed able to do was to present their own portion of the conversation, which they believed contradicted the prosecution&#8217;s narrative that &#8220;this is a sober, unburdening and admission by Ms. Ellison of what she had done.&#8221; In their recording, taken from a later point in the same meeting, an employee stated, &#8220;I am sure this is not that fun for you, but certainly appreciate how open you&#8217;ve been.&#8221; To that, Ellison replied, &#8220;Thanks. I mean, it was kind of fun. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; The employee responded, &#8220;Okay then, never mind.&#8221; Ellison chuckled.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b85fef1-726c-4df1-8e4e-d1177527cf13_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Only eight minutes remained when the last witness was called.

                <![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s way past time for me to pop my head out of the FTX trial rabbithole and bring you this recap of the news in the wider crypto world! Crypto and mainstream media alike have been captivated by the trial, but life goes on elsewhere in the crypto world. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/09/crypto-should-ghost-the-sbf-trial/">Some</a> even seem to be hoping that if enough people ignore the trial, it might just go away &#8212; and perhaps with it, the stain on crypto&#8217;s collective reputation. I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve missed my FTX coverage, I&#8217;ve quarantined it over in the <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/s/the-ftx-files">FTX Files section</a> to allow people to manage their subscription preferences separately, if they want. Check it out! All trial coverage also includes an audio version narrated by a real human being (me) rather than the Substack robo-voice, in case you prefer listening to reading or find it more convenient. I&#8217;m considering incorporating that into my regular writing, too, such as these weekly recap issues &#8212;&nbsp;feedback welcome! I probably wouldn&#8217;t start that until after the trial, though, given time constraints.</p><p>I&#8217;m not including any coverage of the FTX trial in this newsletter, to avoid duplication, though there is some FTX-adjacent stuff I&#8217;ll cover. For those of you waiting for trial coverage, sit tight, it&#8217;s on its way!</p><p>Finally, a quick plug: If you aren&#8217;t a paid subscriber and would like to become one, check out the <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/pay-what-you-want">pay-what-you want subscription options</a>. My writing here will always be paywall-free, but paid subscribers get the opportunity to join in the lively comments section and that warm fuzzy feeling that comes from knowing you&#8217;re making it possible for me to keep doing this kind of writing.</p><p>With all that out of the way:</p><h2>In the courts</h2><p>Do Kwon, the founder of the decimated Terra/Luna project, is still sitting in jail in Montenegro, with no real news on an eventual release or extradition. The SEC has requested he be extradited to the US so they can question him, which Kwon has opposed: &#8220;An order mandating something that is impossible serves no practical purpose and risks undermining judicial authority.&#8221; He&#8217;s also argued that providing written testimony would violate his right to due process.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> However, he has suggested he might be open to being deposed if the SEC is willing to travel to Montenegro.</p><p>Su Zhu, a co-founder of the collapsed Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, was arrested while trying to leave Singapore, and imprisoned for four months. This imprisonment doesn&#8217;t reflect the entirety of allegations against him, but is rather related only to the fact that he&#8217;s refused to comply with liquidators.

The FTC lawsuit, which also named Voyager as a defendant, pertained to misleading statements that led customers to believe accounts at the firm were FDIC insured. Voyager agreed to a $1.65 billion judgment to settle the charges, though it will be postponed until Voyager customers are repaid (to the extent possible).

Ray III for advertising itself as "the first CPA firm to officially open its headquarters inside the metaverse".</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg" width="558" height="360" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:775,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:558,&quot;bytes&quot;:53145,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e76d03-c591-4066-bbc8-8ae4510dd811_775x500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Can&#8217;t wait to strap on my VR headset and&#8230; meet with my accountant.

Some 800 scrolls were discovered by builders in 1752, but have sat dormant for 270 years as scientists patiently waited for technology to progress to the point that something might be able to be

                <![CDATA[<p>Caroline Ellison broke down in tears on the witness stand when she recounted the relief she felt after FTX collapsed. &#8220;That was overall the worst week of my life,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but one of the feelings I had was an overwhelming feeling of relief because&#8230; this had been something I had been dreading for so long. &#8230; I felt a sense of relief that I didn&#8217;t have to lie anymore.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I think it probably moved the jury. I know in the room where I was at, you could hear a pin drop,&#8220; <a href="https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT/status/1712202448297656504">said</a> the crypto crime detective known as Coffeezilla, who joined the throng of people lined up to hear the prosecution finish questioning their star witness today.</p><p>Ellison had previously testified that she was in &#8220;a constant state of dread&#8221; because Alameda Research was dipping into FTX customer funds to the tune of billions of dollars &#8212; an amount she knew they could never repay if it came down to it.</p><h3>The spreadsheets</h3><p>Ellison spent much of the day testifying to spreadsheets she prepared that were somewhat like balance sheets<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> to estimate Alameda&#8217;s financial condition. She testified to creating seven different &#8220;alternative ways of presenting the information&#8221; at Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s direction, hoping that by fudging descriptions and lumping in Alameda&#8217;s borrowed FTX customer funds into other loan categories, Alameda&#8217;s lenders would be more likely to lend them money &#8212; or at least not recall all outstanding loans and run screaming. When asked what she thought Bankman-Fried meant by &#8220;alternatives&#8221;, she explained that she believed he was instructing her to &#8220;come up with ways to conceal the things in our balance sheet that we both thought looked bad.&#8221;</p><p>While the spreadsheet titled &#8220;main&#8221; was the most accurate reflection of Alameda&#8217;s finances, it was not one that she shared outside of the company, or even outside of the very narrow circle of insiders that included Sam Bankman-Fried.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png" width="1456" height="1152" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1152,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:233876,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6471597-2fa8-41e9-a962-0063a256121d_1716x1358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">One of Ellison&#8217;s spreadsheets.

She testified that she had considered writing something like &#8220;FTX customer money&#8221;, but had been repeatedly warned by Bankman-Fried not to put anything in writing that could someday be used in court. According to Ellison, Bankman-Fried had held multiple company-wide meetings to drive that point home with employees, saying that they should consider the &#8220;<em>New York Times</em> test&#8221; before writing something in a messaging app: would you be comfortable reading this on the front page of the <em>New York Times</em>? I don&#8217;t suppose Ellison took it as a direct threat at the time, but I imagine recounting that story on the witness stand feels a little different after the person talking about the &#8220;<em>New York Times</em> test&#8221; has themself leaked your intimate diary entries to the <em>Times</em>.</p><p>Ellison testified about a rocky period during June 2022, when in the wake of the Three Arrows Capital collapse [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?collection=3ac&amp;id=three-arrows-capital-crypto-hedge-fund-may-be-insolvent">W3IGG</a></em>] and the massive shockwave it sent through the crypto markets, lenders including Genesis began recalling loans to Alameda. Many of these were the open-term loans Ellison had described <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-fried-for-president">the previous day</a>: a riskier type of loan for the borrower, because the lender could demand repayment at any time. Genesis themselves were in pretty dire straits  at that time, with Bankman-Fried reportedly telling Ellison that they might &#8220;go under or have to default on some loans&#8221; if Alameda couldn&#8217;t return the funds quickly. (Genesis ultimately was able to flounder along for several more months, before filing for bankruptcy in January 2023 [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=genesis-files-for-bankruptcy">W3IGG</a></em>]).</p><p>Bankman-Fried instructed Ellison to repay all the loans that were getting recalled, which she did, and which she testified he knew meant she would need to draw down the line of credit with FTX. At this point, she knew she was repaying Alameda&#8217;s loans with FTX customer funds. According to her, she thought &#8220;there was some chance that we would be able to fix things somehow, that maybe Sam would be able to raise money to repay our loans.&#8220;</p><p>Bankman-Fried did eventually try to raise money, or at least he talked about trying to. While FTX was in the process of acquiring BlockFi during an emergency bail-out in June of 2022 [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?collection=blockfi&amp;id=ftx-reportedly-approaches-a-deal-to-buy-blockfi">W3IGG</a></em>], Bankman-Fried talked about trying to &#8220;get BlockFi&#8217;s assets moved on to FTX&#8221; &#8212; and thus, presumably, made available to Alameda just like all the others. In October 2022, the month before FTX&#8217;s collapse, Bankman-Fried was talking about selling FTX equity to outside investors, primarily Saudi prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who like Bankman-Fried is arguably better known by a three-letter acronym. This doesn&#8217;t appear to have ever happened, which is probably for the best for Bankman-Fried given MBS&#8217;s&#8230; ah&#8230; methods.</p><h3>The Thing</h3><p>The prosecution quizzed Ellison for a while on the topic of the alleged bribe to Chinese officials to unfreeze around $1 billion of Alameda&#8217;s assets, which had been frozen in early 2021 at the direction of the Chinese government as part of a money laundering investigation into a (reportedly) unrelated third party who had traded with Alameda. Although Bankman-Fried <em>has</em> been charged with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a>, it&#8217;s one of the charges that will be tried in a subsequent trial tentatively scheduled for March, and so the judge was careful to instruct jurors that discussion of alleged bribery was only to be considered in the context of establishing the degree of trust between Bankman-Fried and Ellison.</p><p>The story Ellison told about the FTX and Alameda executives&#8217; attempts to regain control of these assets over the period of about a year was pretty wild. First, they tried hiring a Chinese lawyer to negotiate on their behalf, which was fruitless. Then, they used &#8220;various trading strategies&#8221; to try to move the funds to accounts that were not frozen. One such strategy involved creating several accounts with credentials belonging to Thai prostitutes, then performing imbalanced trades such that the frozen accounts lost money and the new accounts made money. This apparently didn&#8217;t work either.</p><p>Finally, Ellison referred to &#8220;doing things David Ma&#8217;s way&#8221;, referring to a trader at Alameda. This suggestion very much upset another trader, named Handi Yang, whose father was a Chinese government official. Ellison said that Handi was &#8220;very upset and protesting a lot and saying that she thought it was a bad idea and would get us in trouble.&#8221; At one point, Ellison said that Bankman-Fried grew frustrated that Handi wasn&#8217;t letting others speak, and after asking a few times, &#8220;yelled at her to shut the fuck up.&#8221;</p><p>Ellison was never explicitly told what &#8220;doing things David Ma&#8217;s way&#8221; meant, but inferred from the coded language and Handi&#8217;s reaction that they were talking about bribing a Chinese official. An employee at Alameda asked her about the payment, even asking if she was aware that it might violate the FCPA. Ellison lied that lawyers had signed off on it. Later, when creating a summary of Alameda&#8217;s large gains and losses, Ellison wrote that the firm had lost $150 million from &#8220;the thing?&#8221; to avoid recording the bribe in writing.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca89a1c-76ba-47d9-9ac2-11c2ffe7c857_758x242.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca89a1c-76ba-47d9-9ac2-11c2ffe7c857_758x242.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca89a1c-76ba-47d9-9ac2-11c2ffe7c857_758x242.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca89a1c-76ba-47d9-9ac2-11c2ffe7c857_758x242.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca89a1c-76ba-47d9-9ac2-11c2ffe7c857_758x242.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ca89a1c-76ba-47d9-9ac2-11c2ffe7c857_758x242.png" width="520" height="166.01583113456465" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ca89a1c-76ba-47d9-9ac2-11c2ffe7c857_758x242.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:242,&quot;width&quot;:758,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:520,&quot;bytes&quot;:33572,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&#8226;

you&#8217;re still taking customer funds that you&#8217;re not allowed to take. Still, ridiculous lines of argument seem to be all the defense has left.</p><p>Apparently anticipating this line of questioning, the prosecution dove into the subject of Ellison&#8217;s and Bankman-Fried&#8217;s conversations about Alameda&#8217;s hedges. At one point, she described a dramatic conversation between her and Bankman-Fried in around August 2022, which occurred in the study of the luxe Bahamian penthouse they shared.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> The pair had just broken up for a second time that spring, and things were already strained between them.</p><p>Bankman-Fried unloaded on her, saying that Alameda should have hedged far more than it had, and that it was a huge mistake on her part not to have. He said that Alameda&#8217;s dire financial condition was her fault. This adds to testimony from previous days, including where the prosecution produced a document written by Bankman-Fried and shared with Nishad Singh and Gary Wang (but not with Ellison) in which he outlined wanting to shut down Alameda Research. In it, he wrote: &#8220;The fact that we didn&#8217;t hedge as much as we should have alone cost more in EV than all the money Alameda has ever made or ever will make, and that&#8217;s the kind of critical mistake we&#8217;re likely to make if I&#8217;m not actually running the show there.&#8220;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank"

GX-18</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>According to Ellison, his anger largely revolved around an incident earlier in 2022 when Bankman-Fried had mentioned selling short some S&amp;P 500 futures to hedge against crypto prices falling. When crypto prices did fall substantially, she testified: &#8220;Sam sent a bunch more messages being angry at Alameda for not doing that&#8220;.</p><p>Speaking about the conversation in the study, Ellison stated that &#8220;he was speaking pretty loudly and strongly&#8221;, to the point that she &#8220;got very upset, started crying, and had trouble continuing the conversation&#8221;. While she acknowledged during her testimony that she &#8220;could and should have done things differently&#8221;, and could have hedged more sooner, she &#8220;also thought that Sam was the one who chose to make all these investments that put us in a leverage position in the first place&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;I thought that hedging could have helped our situation, but I felt that the fundamental reason we were in the situation was that we had borrowed these billions of dollars in open-term loans and used them for illiquid investments,&#8221; she summarized.</p><h3>The hair</h3><p>Ellison threw a wrench in the defense&#8217;s attempts to argue that Bankman-Fried couldn&#8217;t have stolen money, because look at his slobbish outfit choices, unkempt hair, and modest choice of a Toyota Corolla!</p><p>Speaking about his public image, Ellison described it as carefully crafted. &#8220;He said he thought his hair had been very valuable,&#8221; Ellison explained, saying that he believed that he had gotten higher bonuses while interning at Jane Street because of his unkempt mane. </p><p>Asked about the Corolla, she told prosecutors that they had both been assigned luxury company vehicles in The Bahamas, but that she and Bankman-Fried had traded theirs for a Toyota Corolla and a Honda Civic, respectively, believing it to be &#8220;better for his image&#8221;.</p><p>As for the famed beanbag, well&#8230; he did sleep on the beanbag a lot, she said. When he wasn&#8217;t sleeping in the multimillion dollar penthouse, or one of his other apartments, that is.</p><h3>The defendant&#8217;s reaction</h3><p>Bankman-Fried has spent most of the trial thus far glued to his air-gapped laptop, either typing notes or reviewing documents. During Ellison&#8217;s testimony, however, prosecutors requested a sidebar with the judge. &#8220;The defendant has laughed, visibly shaken his head, and scoffed,&#8221; accused Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon. She expressed her concern to the judge that, given their romantic history, his past attempts to intimidate her, and the imbalanced power dynamic that defined much of their relationship, his response might be impacting Ellison&#8217;s testimony. Judge Kaplan told Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyer, to talk to his client during the break, and instruct him to cut out any visible reactions he may or may not be having to her testimony.</p><h3>The lawyers</h3><p>Sidebars such as this were somewhat frequent today, as the defense team &#8212; mostly unsuccessfully &#8212; objected to various lines of questioning. At one point, Cohen tried to prevent the prosecution from presenting a document about the working relationship between Modulo and Alameda, two trading firms. Described to me by a journalist who was attending in person at the courthouse<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> as a &#8220;stream of consciousness&#8221;-style document in which Bankman-Fried occasionally referred to himself in the third person, Cohen asked, &#8220;what conceivable relevance is it that he wrote these items, only to show that he&#8217;s some sort of crazy person?&#8221; Ultimately, the prosecution&#8217;s arguments for showing the document won out over the defense&#8217;s.</p><p>The day wrapped up with some conversation between the legal teams and the judge. The prosecution had asked to prevent the defense team from bringing up the fact that one of Alameda&#8217;s investments in an AI startup called Anthropic has reportedly skyrocketed in value since FTX&#8217;s $500 million investment. According to the defense, this is relevant because Alameda was engaged in a &#8220;portfolio&#8221; trading strategy, where many of their investments could be duds if just a few of them were highly successful. According to the prosecution, this risks suggesting to the jury that the fraud wa s okay if the money can eventually be recouped. Judge Kaplan sided with the prosecution, stating, &#8220;This is like saying that if I break into the Federal Reserve Bank, make off with a million bucks, spend it all on Powerball tickets and happen to win, it was okay.&#8221; He did, however, leave the door open to the defense calling a witness qualified to speak on the nature of venture investing.</p><p>As for the question of whether the defense is allowed to cross-examine Ellison about whether lawyers were involved in Bankman-Fried&#8217;s policy of setting Signal chats to auto-delete, Kaplan declined to rule on it this afternoon. However, the defense faces an uphill battle even if they are allowed to pursue this line of questioning. While Cohen said that he expected Ellison would answer affirmatively that &#8220;lawyers were involved&#8221; in the auto-deletion policy, he seemed reticent when the judge asked if he was willing to ask if they were involved <em>and aware</em> that the reason for the policy was to ensure that evidence would disappear.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f74fc13-486d-40d3-aa66-78742a772567_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The prosecution wrapped up their questioning shortly before court was due to end for the day.

They repeatedly tried to get him to agree with their insinuation that FTX and Alameda Research were solvent on paper even up through the November 2022 collapse, if you believed their illiquid assets (namely the FTT and Serum tokens) could be sold en masse at mark-to-market values. The defense team probably did not appreciate Wang repeatedly pointing out that those tokens were illiquid and couldn&#8217;t be sold for the stated values claimed by the defense.</p><p>The defense also repeatedly referred to funds stored in &#8220;Alameda&#8217;s bank accounts&#8221; &#8212; which Wang pointed out were actually funds deposited by FTX customers and belonging to them, not to Alameda.</p><p>The defense tried to sow doubt in various parts of Wang&#8217;s testimony, such as that he had heard Bankman-Fried telling investors and journalists that Alameda was treated like any other trading firm on FTX. They suggested that he hadn&#8217;t heard the question on the other end of the line, and that it was possible that Bankman-Fried was answering honestly about some of the ways that Alameda was treated equivalently. They also tried to spin a story that Bankman-Fried might not have been aware of Alameda&#8217;s debt to FTX, suggesting that perhaps the spreadsheet with Alameda&#8217;s debt that Wang had testified to constantly seeing on Bankman-Fried&#8217;s screen was perhaps something else. Attempts to get Wang to suggest that Bankman-Fried was concerned that Caroline Ellison wasn&#8217;t &#8220;up to the task&#8221; of being CEO of Alameda Research were swatted down by the judge, who balked at their attempts to get Wang to do the testifying when it came to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s feelings.</p><p>Finally, the defense tried to suggest to jurors that perhaps Gary Wang was simply saying what the government wanted to hear because he&#8217;s hoping they will send what&#8217;s called a 5K letter to the judge: a letter outlining that he had substantially cooperated with the prosecution, which would then allow the judge to consider a lighter sentence. This was a tough argument to make, I think, largely because it was preempted by the prosecution, who had already brought out the plea agreements (and immunity grants, for the witnesses testifying with immunity) to underscore that the agreements are conditional on them <em>telling the truth</em>, not on that they say things that are helpful to the prosecution. At one point during Adam Yedidia&#8217;s cross-examination, defense attorney Christian Everdell seemed to hint at the idea that prosecutors might punish witnesses for telling the truth if it was inconvenient to the prosecution, saying &#8220;If they thought you were lying, they could prosecute you for perjury, correct? &#8230; It was up to the government to decide whether or not you were telling them the truth, correct?&#8221; This seems like a challenging defense to bring in front of a jury, given that jurors tend to generally be rather trusting of the criminal justice system and of  government officials, and unlikely to entertain what may sound to them like a conspiracy theory.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b9915c-6a07-4d94-9056-22d6dead7602_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Caroline Ellison, former Alameda Research CEO and on-and-off girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, was next to take the stand. She outlined how Alameda Research had withdrawn billions in customer assets while she was CEO, at Bankman-Fried&#8217;s direction and thanks to the systems he had set up to allow those transfers to happen. She also described incorrect balance sheets that Bankman-Fried instructed her to make, which were used to mislead lenders by making Alameda&#8217;s assets and liabilities look less risky than in reality. She also explained that Bankman-Fried was still the CEO of Alameda Research when it began dipping into customer funds to use for its own trading purposes. </p><p>Ellison spoke of a time in 2020 when she raised concerns that auditors might catch Alameda trading with FTX&#8217;s customers&#8217; funds, to which Bankman-Fried replied with something like, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t worry, the auditors aren&#8217;t going to look at that.&#8221; She also described the first time Alameda took an amount around a billion dollars from FTX customer funds, which she said was at Bankman-Fried&#8217;s direct instruction, in order to buy out Binance&#8217;s stake in FTX.</p><p>Ellison also offered some interesting new tidbits, such as that Bankman-Fried instructed her to have Alameda prop up the price of the FTT token if it ever fell below a dollar, and got upset if she ever discussed this manipulation around other employees. He later instructed her &#8212; even when the price was well above a dollar &#8212; to buy the token if a large amount of it was ever  sold onto the market, or if the price was falling. He was also the one, she said, who told her to add Alameda&#8217;s substantial FTT holdings, marked to market, on their balance sheet in order to make the firm more attractive to lenders. And he was the one who instructed her to offer to buy up FTT tokens when Binance threatened to sell them, in an incident that only compounded the panic around FTX&#8217;s solvency.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png" width="608" height="264.4728132387707" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:368,&quot;width&quot;:846,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:608,&quot;bytes&quot;:77528,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot; Caroline @carolinecapital @cz_binance  if you're looking to minimize the market impact on your FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22! 11:03 AM &#183; Nov 6, 2022&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt=" Caroline @carolinecapital @cz_binance  if you're looking to minimize the market impact on your FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22! 11:03 AM &#183; Nov 6, 2022" title=" Caroline @carolinecapital @cz_binance  if you're looking to minimize the market impact on your FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22! 11:03 AM &#183; Nov 6, 2022" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbef33622-3893-44d2-aa67-be640762d8a2_846x368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A tweet by Caroline Ellison, sent while FTX and Alameda Research were floundering but had not yet fully collapsed.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Ellison talked about Bankman-Fried&#8217;s advice to her on borrowing from external lenders, which was generally to borrow as much as she could under any terms she could get. She spoke about being concerned with the risk involved in taking out open-term loans that could be recalled at any moment, and putting the funds into illiquid long-term investments in early stage companies, but said that Bankman-Fried was more willing to take risks than most people if he believed they had &#8220;positive EV [expected value]&#8221;.</p><p>Ellison also spoke about her personal and professional relationship with Bankman-Fried, including that she didn&#8217;t feel prepared to be the CEO of Alameda Research. &#8220;I handled a lot of day-to-day decisions and responsibilities in Alameda,&#8220; she said. &#8220;But for any major decisions I would always run them by Sam, and I would always ultimately defer to Sam if he thought that we should do something.&#8221;</p><p>Ellison also outlined a time in 2021 when Bankman-Fried laid out a list of hypothetical scenarios to her &#8212; ones that would eventually be part of what ultimately happened to FTX, like FTT dropping in price &#8212; and asking her to evaluate the possible risk if Alameda were to do another $3 billion in venture investments. She produced her analysis to Bankman-Fried and discussed it with him , concluding that it would &#8220;put Alameda in a significantly riskier position and make it much less likely or almost impossible that we would be able to pay off our loans if all of our loans were called at once.&#8221; She explained that she believed if loans were recalled, they would need to use customer funds to pay them off. Despite that, Bankman-Fried decided to do the venture investments anyway.

It&#8217;s possible that the defense will try to delve deeply into Ellison&#8217;s personal life &#8212; including by asking questions about her romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried but also potentially about things like her illicit drug use [see <em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137602559/defense">Preview</a></em>] &#8212; a strategy that could help to discredit her but could also bear the substantial risk of alienating the jury and making the defense team (and by extension, Bankman-Fried) even less likable to jurors.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd5ceb5-2b61-41ee-9ac6-e326630b64b6_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Social image created from <a href="https://ee.usembassy.gov/2021-02-04/">U.S. Government image</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bankman-fried-cryptocurrency-trial-3f42c055a8040ad8fb2edb4c7319f153">image of Bankman-Fried</a> via the AP.</em></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Bankman-Fried has said he would be eager to flip a coin that would destroy the world on a tails result, so long as the result if it came up heads was that the world would be more than twice as good.</p><p></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>We got our first glance at the FTX codebase on Friday. The prosecution brought out Github screenshots as they questioned cooperating witness <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137602559/gary-wang">Gary Wang</a>, the former CTO of FTX who at various times was responsible for the codebases powering both FTX and Alameda Research. Wang has pleaded guilty to four charges.</p><p>Although there is some risk of confusing the jury when presenting them with code snippets, prosecutors had Wang step through what the code is doing in a way that seemed pretty clear to me.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> It probably helped that FTX&#8217;s engineers wrote decently clean code, with descriptive variable names and concise functions, and chose a very human-readable language (Python).</p><p>Note to self: if you&#8217;re going to write code to do fraud, make it messy and unreadable to reduce the chances it&#8217;s later put in front of a jury as evidence.</p><p>Much of the conversation revolved around the <code>allow_negative</code> flag that was introduced to the FTX codebase on August 1, 2019. Wang testified that Sam Bankman-Fried had asked him and <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137602559/nishad-singh">Nishad Singh</a> (former FTX engineering director, who has also pleaded guilty) to add the flag. Github screenshots show Singh making a code change to add the column in the database, and adding logic to exempt accounts with the flag from checks that would otherwise determine if they had sufficient funds to withdraw.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank"

People complain that @CryptoHayes trades against the market, yet FTX and your shop is out there.  SBF @SBF_FTX Jul 31, 2019 Alameda is a liquidity provider on FTX but their account is just like everyone else's.  Alameda's incentive is just for FTX to do as well as possible; by far the dominant factor is helping to make the trading experience as good as possible.  Bitshine @bitshine_ I guess we're just suppose to trust that you wont get preferential treatment on your own platform.

According to Wang, the limit was originally set to &#8220;a few million dollars&#8221;, but was then increased to $1 billion. After they ran up against that limit, too, Bankman-Fried asked him to set it to a number so large that they wouldn&#8217;t likely hit the limit. At that point, Wang set it to around $65 billion.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>Finally, prosecutors questioned Wang about the FTX &#8220;insurance fund&#8221;, which was ostensibly supposed to protect both FTX and its customers from trades that went badly even more quickly than the exchange&#8217;s risk engine could account for. FTX published the fund&#8217;s supposed balance on their website, and bragged widely about its existence, including in testimony to U.S. Congress. However, according to Wang, the number shown on the website was falsified.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"

But it&#8217;s really hard to come up with a good explanation for why the fund was being incremented by a <em>random</em> fluctuating number that was in no way tied to any actual account balance, besides the obvious: that FTX was trying to present a falsified but convincing number to customers. That would be fraud.</p><p>Elsewhere in the code, it&#8217;s possible to observe that the amount of FTT in the fund was actually represented by a hardcoded value in the user interface, and was not pulling from an external datasource to get a real number. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44f41549-76a4-4aa3-96cd-de22f5319e15_1414x1742.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44f41549-76a4-4aa3-96cd-de22f5319e15_1414x1742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44f41549-76a4-4aa3-96cd-de22f5319e15_1414x1742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44f41549-76a4-4aa3-96cd-de22f5319e15_1414x1742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44f41549-76a4-4aa3-96cd-de22f5319e15_1414x1742.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44f41549-76a4-4aa3-96cd-de22f5319e15_1414x1742.png" width="1414" height="1742" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/44f41549-76a4-4aa3-96cd-de22f5319e15_1414x1742.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1742,&quot;width&quot;:1414,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1363503,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;function InsuranceFundInformation() {   let insuranceFund = useData('/stats/insurance_fund');   let classes = useStyles();   if (!insuranceFund) {     return null;   }   return (     <Card className={classes.card}>       <CardContent>         <Typography variant=\&quot;h5\&quot; gutterBottom>           <Trans>Insurance Fund</Trans>         </Typography>         <Typography>           <Trans>             Size:

One such example was in 2021, when a trader was able to exploit a bug in FTX&#8217;s margin system that allowed them to take out a massive position in the MobileCoin cryptocurrency. They were eventually liquidated, and FTX suffered a loss of &#8220;several hundred million dollars,&#8221; according to Wang.</p><p>Prosecutors haven&#8217;t mentioned it, but Sam Bankman-Fried would go on to testify under oath in front of the U.S. Congress in May 2022 that &#8220;the insurance fund has paid out a net total of $9.5 million&#8221; in the preceding three years, and that &#8220;the single biggest daily drawdown from the FTX.com insurance fund was $4.7 million.&#8221;</p><p>They did, however, play a clip from the <em>Odd Lots</em> podcast in which Sam Bankman-Fried lied to interviewer Matt Levine, saying that FTX&#8217;s risk management engine was so good that they had &#8220;never had a day &#8230; where there&#8217;s more money that we lost in blowouts to revenue that we made just from trading fees&#8221;.</p><div class="native-audio-embed" data-component-name="AudioPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;label&quot;:null,&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;7d7885a6-92ae-42b7-89ba-22ea6dfbaa12&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:35.63102,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p>Wang went on to testify that the MobileCoin losses, and other similar losses that exceeded the amounts available in the insurance fund, were &#8220;taken on&#8221; by Alameda &#8212; that is, Alameda took over the account&#8217;s positions and collateral, effectively absorbing the loss as its own. Wang said that Bankman-Fried reasoned &#8220;that FTX&#8217;s balance sheets are more public than Alameda&#8217;s balance sheets, that investors have access to FTX&#8217;s finances but not Alameda&#8217;s finances.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed, just the previous day we had heard testimony from Paradigm venture capitalist Matt Huang, during which balance sheets were shown to the jury that showed $63 million in estimated trading expenses and $63 million in estimated other expenses for all of 2021 &#8212; clearly omitting the &#8220;several hundred million dollars&#8221; lost to the MobileCoin incident.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The defense team only briefly questioned Wang before the court session ended, but began by suggesting to the jury that he might be saying what the government wants to hear in the hopes of receiving a lighter sentence (he faces a maximum of 50 years in prison, but will likely receive a substantially shorter or even no custodial sentence due to his cooperation). They also tried to offer an alternative explanation for the <code>allow_negative</code> flag: that Alameda was in charge of doing conversions from US dollars to stablecoins, and for a brief period in this transaction they needed to borrow the funds from FTX before returning them in stablecoin form.

The prosecution likely carefully selected him as someone who only used FTX&#8217;s spot trading features and intentionally sidestepped its products that allow users to trade on margin or borrow money, anticipating an eventual argument from the defense that FTX&#8217;s collapse could be blamed on risk inherent to margin trading that customers knew they were taking on when they opted to use the platform. He also spoke of being influenced to choose FTX in part by the company&#8217;s ad campaigns and photos in the news of Bankman-Fried cozying up to politicians. The defense team asked him whether he understood that cryptocurrencies were volatile and risky, which he said he did; however, prosecutors later gave him the opportunity to clarify that he believed crypto to be risky because of his tokens&#8217; volatility, not because FTX might disappear with the tokens entirely.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2665443,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0dc1-f18b-4a83-8a62-e48d55b8589b_1536x1152.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Adam Yedidia (second from left) at dinner with FTX employees including Gary Wang (third from left)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Second to testify was former employee and Bahamian penthouse roommate Adam Yedidia, who worked for FTX as a software developer.

He said that he&#8217;d confronted Bankman-Fried about the debt, and Bankman-Fried &#8220;looked nervous&#8221;, explaining he believed they could repay the debt in six months to three years. At that point, Yedidia trusted him to &#8220;handle the situation&#8221;. Yedidia would go on to quit FTX shortly after its collapse, as soon as he learned of the allegations that the company had intentionally misappropriated customer funds.</p><p>Perhaps the worst moment of Yedidia&#8217;s testimony for the defense team was when the prosecutors asked &#8220;Why did your view of FTX change?&#8221; &#8220;FTX defrauded its customers,&#8221; Yedidia answered simply.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" target="_self">8</a></p><p>The third witness to testify was Matt Huang, a venture capitalist working for the crypto-focused fund, Paradigm. Paradigm invested $278 million into FTX. According to Huang, there were &#8220;concerns about value leakage to Alameda&#8221;, but they decided to invest anyway, believing that the two companies were properly firewalled. Paradigm later marked their investment to zero.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9" href="#footnote-9" target="_self">9</a></p><p>The last person to testify on Thursday was Gary Wang, the CTO and coding whiz behind much of Alameda and FTX&#8217;s software. Wang pleaded guilty to four fraud charges in December 2022, and has been cooperating with the prosecution since. The prosecution only got a few questions in before the trial concluded for the day, but they were to the point:<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10" target="_self">10</a></p><blockquote><p>Prosecutor: Did you commit crimes at FTX?</p><p>Gary Wang: Yes. With Nishad Singh, Caroline Ellison, and Sam Bankman-Fried.</p><p>Prosecutor: What was the wire fraud?</p><p>Wang:  We allowed Alameda to withdraw unlimited funds.</p></blockquote><p>Wang has been implicated in coding the &#8220;backdoor&#8221; that allowed Alameda Research to dip into customer funds allocated to FTX, a topic that will certainly be explored in more depth during tomorrow&#8217;s questioning. Although Caroline Ellison has been described as the star witness in this case, I think Gary Wang&#8217;s testimony is likely to be pivotal as well. Bankman-Fried and others have described Wang as the only person who truly understood how Alameda&#8217;s and FTX&#8217;s software worked, a level of understanding that I imagine has been critical to the prosecution as they&#8217;ve prepared their case. Although Sam Bankman-Fried notoriously instructed his employees to set their Signal encrypted messaging app to auto-delete messages so they couldn&#8217;t later be accessed by regulators or other prying eyes, prosecutors were also able to delve into Wang&#8217;s Slack messages &#8212; which we know about thanks to a complaint from the defense team in August that they were struggling to sift through <em>750,000 pages</em> of them that had just been produced by the prosecution [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-37-things-sam-is-freaking-out">I37</a></em>].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1d1e5a1-3e7f-434c-ae1c-ddfff407db27_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Thus far, Bankman-Fried himself has played a minimal role in the trial. Most of the reporting about him has to do with the fact that he&#8217;s cleaned up his trademark just-out-of-bed appearance, which he once carefully cultivated. &#8220;I think it's important for people to think I look crazy&#8221;, he said to the <em>New York Times</em> several months before the collapse, in a profile titled, &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/14/business/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">A Crypto Emperor&#8217;s Vision: No Pants, His Rules</a>&#8221;. Now, he&#8217;s cut his hair, and apparently managed to reign in the once-signature rapidfire leg bouncing. Whether this will ultimately help him or not is less clear, given the defense seems to be hoping to make the argument that he was just a disorganized kid and things fell through the cracks, an argument that may not necessarily be bolstered by making him dress and groom like the grown adult businessman he actually is.</p><p>The big question on everyone&#8217;s mind is: will Bankman-Fried testify? I doubt his lawyers want him to, as he is both abrasive and evasive even on his best days. He likes to try to talk circles around interviewers &#8212; a tactic that may pay off with friendly tech journos or the crypto crowd, but is less likely to work for sworn testimony in front of an experienced cross-examiner. </p><p>Bankman-Fried, on the other hand, has shown nothing but conviction that he can talk his way out of this, if he just gets the chance. He spent weeks after the collapse talking to anyone who would listen, from journalists like Andrew Ross Sorkin to random people on Twitter <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-13-dont-threaten-me-with-a">like me</a> [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-13-dont-threaten-me-with-a">I13</a></em>]. That&#8217;s been muted lately, but more likely due to the gag order [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-35-pondering-my-orb">I35</a></em>] and subsequent return to jail [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-36">I36</a></em>] rather than any change of heart on his part. Meanwhile, the judge has told him that he has the right to testify, even if his lawyers don&#8217;t want him to. That temptation may ultimately prove too strong for Bankman-Fried.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90b8fb52-2628-4f1e-835d-2821df03ac0a_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Video excerpt from FTX advertisements uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aCGMyrFn-8">YouTube</a>.</em></p><p><em>Case exhibits via the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/05/sam-bankman-fried-trial-live-updates-reactions-analysis/#29003895">New York Post</a>.</em></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.innercitypress.com/sbf1defenseopeningicp100423.html">Bankman-Fried Didn't Steal His Lawyer Tells Jury It was Caroline Ellison Who Didn't Hedge</a>&#8220;, <em>Inner City Press.</em></p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Just like Donald Trump!</p></div></div><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-3" href="#footnote-anchor-3" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">3</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67013020">Sam Bankman-Fried: FTX crypto empire 'built on lies' -

                <![CDATA[<p>A few moments broke the typical tedium of the jury selection process, as the trial kicked off to determine if Sam Bankman-Fried is guilty of fraud in the $8 billion collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency empire. Amidst boilerplate questions about medical conditions or life circumstances that might prevent candidates from serving for the planned six-week-long trial, Judge Kaplan probed them on their involvement with finance, cryptocurrency, and the companies at the heart of this case.</p><p>Several of the jurors responded in the affirmative when asked if they or members of their families ever traded cryptocurrency. &#8220;Win or lose?&#8221; asked the judge. All of them had lost money. &#8220;I invested in crypto. I did lose a lot,&#8221; said one candidate. &#8220;My twin brother invested even more and it did finally ruin him.&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> He wasn&#8217;t selected.</p><p>Other jurors expressed strong dislike for cryptocurrency. &#8220;I'm not sure I could be totally unbiased about crypto given the history and everything negative I've heard about it,&#8220; said one. Others confessed to being baffled about the concept in general, including one who&#8217;d tried to have his son explain it and still came away feeling foggy. &#8220;You probably have a lot of company in this courtroom,&#8221; replied Kaplan, who also explained that strong feelings about cryptocurrency would not be relevant to the case.</p><p>One juror expressed that the case reminded him of the 2008&#8211;2009 Bernie Madoff case, in which the mastermind of a $65 billion Ponzi scheme ultimately received the maximum sentence of 150 years in prison. Judge Kaplan quickly called a sidebar, likely concerned that such a comparison might bias other jurors, and dismissed the candidate.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>Many of them had connections to the finance industry, which is perhaps unsurprising for a trial taking place in Manhattan. One prospective juror &#8212;&nbsp;not ultimately selected &#8212; worked for a company that had lost money in FTX.</p><p>One candidate worried that she might not be able to reach a guilty verdict if it meant Bankman-Fried might be sentenced to death. Although judges normally stress to jurors that they must render judgment regardless of the possible sentencing, Kaplan reassured her that a death sentence was not among the possible outcomes of this case.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><p>Jury selection spilled over into day two of the case, but by Wednesday morning the twelve-person panel &#8212; with six alternates &#8212; was decided.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25261707-85fa-4f39-8ece-c4c5ee3361da_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Sidebar: I&#8217;ve experimented with recording a real audio version of this post (rather than Substack&#8217;s computer-generated voice) for those who prefer listening to reading.

At no point does Lewis seem to reflect on whether the six months he spent shadowing Bankman-Fried prior to the CEO&#8217;s fall from grace &#8212; during which Lewis thought he was writing the story of a nerdy tycoon&#8217;s rise to unimaginable wealth and influence in a possible new sector of finance &#8212;&nbsp;may have influenced his own evaluation of the situation. The time Lewis spent observing Bankman-Fried in the company&#8217;s ritzy Bahamian offices, joining him on travels abroad, and even accompanying him to parties where they brushed elbows with the likes of Hillary Clinton and Leonardo DiCaprio certainly seems to have endeared the fallen billionaire and now accused fraudster to Lewis, who throughout the book continuously overlooks red flags and omits context that would paint a very different picture.</p><p>To this day, Bankman-Fried claims that the collapse of FTX, and the more than $8 billion in missing customer funds, is all the result of mismanagement and sloppy record-keeping, but not intentional fraud. By writing a book that largely backs up Bankman-Fried&#8217;s claims, Lewis seems to be staking his own substantial reputation on this being the truth &#8212; or, at least, on the government being unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it isn&#8217;t. If Bankman-Fried is convicted in the upcoming trial, Lewis&#8217;s book will take an awkward place on the shelves of history.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg" width="406" height="625.4172015404365" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:779,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:406,&quot;bytes&quot;:89718,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Cover of Michael Lewis book: Going Infinite: The rise and fall of a new tycoon&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Cover of Michael Lewis book: Going Infinite: The rise and fall of a new tycoon" title="Cover of Michael Lewis book: Going Infinite: The rise and fall of a new tycoon" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6aa0cca-a691-4bce-b6dc-6c0e91b5f1bb_779x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">It&#8217;s at least a little weird that neither FTX nor Sam Bankman-Fried is mentioned on the cover, right?</figcaption></figure></div><p>It could be that Lewis genuinely believes Bankman-Fried&#8217;s side of the story. Or perhaps he got most of the way through writing a glowing, book-length profile of Bankman-Fried and decided he didn&#8217;t want to throw the whole thing out and start again. Save for a few hasty footnotes referencing the eventual collapse, the first half of the book or so reads as though it was written while Bankman-Fried was still on top of the world, and it doesn&#8217;t appear to have been substantially revised after that changed.</p><p>At one point, while going into gratuitous detail about how Bankman-Fried was unlike other children, Lewis muses: &#8220;Every life is defined not just by what happens in it but by what doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; Similarly, this book is defined by its serious omissions. For example, Lewis repeatedly refers to FTX&#8217;s supposed $1 billion in revenue in 2021 without bothering to mention SEC allegations that Bankman-Fried instructed Nishad Singh to falsify that number.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> When Lewis writes that Bankman-Fried was &#8220;all in on the sacrifice&#8221; that came along with the effective altruist philosophy that supposedly guided him, he fails to include that Bankman-Fried admitted in direct messages with fellow effective altruist and journalist Kelly Piper that all his talk about ethics was mostly a front, a &#8220;dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shibboleths and so everyone likes us&#8221;.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> When Lewis makes brief reference to Alameda Research being named to obscure its involvement in the crypto industry, he doesn&#8217;t include the context that Bankman-Fried has openly admitted that it was motivated by a desire to convince banks to open accounts for them that they otherwise had repeatedly refused.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;285fe959-366f-4f12-b618-bc3d838f663d&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>Throughout the book, Lewis appears far too willing to repeat at face value the things he was told by Bankman-Fried and those close to him. When introducing FTX&#8217;s in-house psychiatrist and &#8220;Senior Professional Coach&#8221;, for example, Lewis regurgitates Bankman-Fried&#8217;s claims that previous therapists were unhelpful to him &#8220;because they could not bring themselves to believe that he was who he was&#8221;. To Bankman-Fried, he was not the problem; it was the therapists who were wrong. Lewis seems to agree that those former therapists, whom he never interviewed, simply &#8220;failed to understand&#8221; Bankman-Fried.</p><p>At other points, he is quick to overlook the concerns others had with Bankman-Fried, or to take Bankman-Fried&#8217;s side. &#8220;Tara [Mac Auley] had long since decided that [Bankman-Fried] was dishonest and manipulative&#8221;, Lewis writes, not interrogating any further why one of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s cofounders had come to feel this way about him years before the eventual collapse. Lewis writes that at one point relationships among Alameda Research employees had deteriorated to the point that engineering director Nishad Singh found himself having to play &#8220;human buffer&#8221; between Bankman-Fried and others who Bankman-Fried constantly offended or upset, but Lewis concludes that those people &#8220;perhaps did not fully understand Sam&#8221;.</p><p>Finally, Lewis occasionally makes points that undermine even the things that he himself has said. Although it is bafflingly relegated to a footnote, Lewis explains that although FTX was a futures exchange, and so it did loan money to its customers, FTX&#8217;s whole selling point was that its &#8220;sophisticated risk engine&#8221; didn&#8217;t expose the company or its customers to potential losses from customers who made bad trades. The ultimate result is that it should never have been <em>possible</em> for there to be a &#8220;run on the exchange&#8221; as Lewis later describes, and it <em>really</em> undermines the unbelievable statements he&#8217;s been making lately in interviews: that &#8220;They had a great real business. If no one had cast aspersions on the business, if there hadn&#8217;t been a run on customers deposits, they&#8217;d still be making tons of money.&#8220;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> Similarly, Lewis undermines his own belief in Bankman-Fried&#8217;s honesty and lack of fraudulent intent when he mentions that Bankman-Fried was aware of the missing customer funds at least as early as October &#8212; a detail that might not seem meaningful to those less familiar with the history because he fails to mention that Bankman-Fried continued to lie to the public into November that &#8220;FTX is fine. Assets are fine&#8221;.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b90845-cdd0-4abb-b6f7-f886927cbbdf_1086x1460.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b90845-cdd0-4abb-b6f7-f886927cbbdf_1086x1460.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b90845-cdd0-4abb-b6f7-f886927cbbdf_1086x1460.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b90845-cdd0-4abb-b6f7-f886927cbbdf_1086x1460.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b90845-cdd0-4abb-b6f7-f886927cbbdf_1086x1460.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b90845-cdd0-4abb-b6f7-f886927cbbdf_1086x1460.png" width="470" height="631.8600368324126" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56b90845-cdd0-4abb-b6f7-f886927cbbdf_1086x1460.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1460,&quot;width&quot;:1086,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:470,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Two tweets by SBF: 1) A competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors.

Because neither Wang nor Lewis himself could get Bankman-Fried to admit to any malfeasance in the days following the collapse, Lewis seems to believe the same will be true at trial. He also decides that it is more likely that four separate FTX executives have decided to admit to crimes they did not commit, potentially facing massive consequences of their own, than that Bankman-Fried could be guilty.</p><p>Instead of digging deeper into that, though, he spends much of the remaining book excoriating the team in charge of FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy, who he insinuates are poorly equipped for the job and motivated only by the massive lawyer fees they can draw down. FTX lawyer Dan Friedberg is introduced only as a former Fenwick &amp; West lawyer and &#8220;the only important grown-up&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> in Bankman-Fried&#8217;s companies who was &#8220;completely, totally crushed&#8221; by their demise &#8212; with no mention of Friedberg&#8217;s own shady history at an online gambling company ultimately brought down by a notorious cheating scandal, or his alleged role in silencing an FTX whistleblower. Lewis endorses Friedberg&#8217;s story that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell have conflicts of interest that should&#8217;ve precluded them from handling the bankruptcy, and insinuates that the bankruptcy judge&#8217;s dismissal of Friedberg&#8217;s attempts to intervene was merely a product of the judge&#8217;s bias in favor of bankruptcy lawyers as he too was once a bankruptcy lawyer.</p><p>Far from providing an incisive inside view into a historic collapse that saw billions of dollars go up in flames at the expense of multitudes of people who were financially ruined, Lewis has still produced the hero story he originally set out to write. By the end of Lewis&#8217;s first ever conversation with Bankman-Fried, he writes: &#8220;I was totally sold&#8221;. By the end of the book chronicling the same man through his company&#8217;s dramatic collapse, that doesn&#8217;t seem to have changed.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a0547-450d-440a-9795-043a43ea0217_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Note: I spoke to Michael Lewis on the &#8220;On Background&#8221; series of his podcast published in May, in which he recorded some of his background research interviews for the book.

Much of FTX&#8217;s balance sheet was also revealed to be denominated in flimsy crypto tokens worth far less in reality than on paper, and a substantial portion of them had been created out of thin air by FTX itself.

That CEO once led Enron through bankruptcy. He&#8217;s said that this situation is worse.</p><p>Only a month after his resignation, Bankman-Fried was arrested in The Bahamas as the U.S. Justice Department brought criminal charges against him. Ten days after that, he decided he no longer wished to fight extradition, and was shipped to the U.S. to begin preparing his defense. Since then, a whirlwind preparation has been underway as attorneys on both sides race to prepare for trial. Leading that effort on Bankman-Fried&#8217;s side is Mark Cohen, the high-powered white collar defense attorney previously known for representing sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>The trial begins tomorrow, October 3, with jury selection slated to last just one day. The most recent trial schedule<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> estimates the whole ordeal will last six weeks, ending on November 9.

The remaining charges only require the prosecution to prove that he planned with at least one other person to commit those crimes, and took steps towards doing so; they don&#8217;t necessarily need to prove that the crimes actually happened.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>An additional five charges, added in superseding indictments after Bankman-Fried&#8217;s extradition, will be tried separately in March 2024 [<em>see <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/129044358/in-the-courts">Issue 30</a></em>]. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to all twelve charges.</p><h3>Sentencing</h3><p>At the risk of getting too far ahead of ourselves, let&#8217;s look at what kind of sentence Bankman-Fried is facing if convicted of any or all charges.</p><p>Several of the charges &#8212; wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering &#8212; each carry a 20-year maximum prison sentence. The commodities fraud and securities fraud charges against him come with 5-year maximum sentences. Some headlines<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> have suggested that Bankman-Fried could be sentenced to as many as 115 years in prison if convicted, though that estimate is calculated by assuming that he will be convicted of all charges, that each conviction would be considered separately rather than grouped, that the maximum sentence would be applied to all charges, and that sentences would run consecutively.</p><p>Some legal experts have predicted more realistic sentences of 10&#8211;20 years if convicted, though they note that Judge Kaplan has broad authority over the duration.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> Others have suggested that such a huge sentence, akin to Bernie Madoff&#8217;s 150 years, could plausibly happen in such a massive and historic fraud case.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> Furthermore, sentencing enhancements related to the enormous monetary losses could add considerably to the calculated sentence. Judge Kaplan himself has said that Bankman-Fried &#8220;could be looking at a very long sentence&#8221; if convicted.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a></p><p>Whether it&#8217;s likely to be 10 years or 100 years, Bankman-Fried is inarguably looking at a very strong possibility that he will spend a significant portion of the rest of his life behind bars.</p><h3>The key witnesses</h3><p>Besides Sam Bankman-Fried, four other high-level executives at the FTX group of companies have been charged, and all four have reached plea deals. Three of them agreed to cooperate with the investigation as a part of their plea, and will almost certainly appear as witnesses at the trial. They were not just Bankman-Fried&#8217;s employees and co-workers, but also his friends, roommates, confidants, and, in one case, a former romantic partner.</p><h4>Caroline Ellison</h4><p>At the time of the collapse, Caroline Ellison was CEO of Alameda Research, the trading firm that tapped into FTX customer funds to finance its bets. The 28-year-old shares a very similar background to Bankman-Fried: she&#8217;s the child of two elite university professors (hers at MIT rather than Stanford), the graduate of an elite university (her from Stanford rather than MIT), a former Jane Street intern (where she met Bankman-Fried), and an <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/02/06/ineffective-altruism-ftx-and-the-future-robot-apocalypse/">effective altruist</a>. She and Bankman-Fried sometimes dated, in what was apparently a tumultuous on-and-off relationship. Ellison is likely to be the government&#8217;s star witness, as she was Bankman-Fried&#8217;s top lieutenant. However, she is also likely to face the fiercest cross-examination over her role in the collapse, and she has already been the target of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attempts to shift blame.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif" width="394" height="295.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:792,&quot;width&quot;:1056,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:394,&quot;bytes&quot;:116424,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/avif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55af4170-4fed-44e8-9f76-94d7127102eb.avif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Caroline Ellison (via <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/22/who-is-alameda-researchs-caroline-ellison/">CoinDesk</a></em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Ellison was one of two additional executives charged in December. As Sam Bankman-Fried was on a plane being extradited from The Bahamas, prosecutors announced they&#8217;d reached a plea deal and that she would be cooperating with the investigations. Ellison pleaded guilty to the same seven charges that Bankman-Fried is facing in this trial [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-14-ftx-friends-flip-on-fellow">I14</a></em>].</p><p>Since the collapse, Bankman-Fried has been trying to shift blame from himself to Ellison, claiming that he hadn&#8217;t been involved in Alameda&#8217;s operations for a long time, and that he had no idea what was going on at his company under Ellison&#8217;s leadership. His decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html">leak some of her personal diary entries to the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html">New York Times</a></em> in July was described by Judge Kaplan as an attempt to tamper with a witness (the second such incident), and was what finally landed him back in jail in August, after several months of house arrest spent at his parents&#8217; California home [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/135947072/sam-bankman-fried">I36</a></em>]. Kaplan described the diary entries as &#8220;something that someone who has been in a relationship would be unlikely to share with anyone except to hurt and frighten the subject&#8221;.</p><p>In a draft of a long Twitter thread that he never ultimately published, but that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-twitter-thread.html">leaked to the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-twitter-thread.html">Times</a></em> after Bankman-Fried was remanded, he blamed &#8220;Alameda&#8217;s failure to hedge&#8221; on Ellison and described her as unsuited for her role [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137154544/ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried">I39</a></em>]. He also claimed that their strained personal relationship influenced her actions, in what seems to be an ongoing attempt on his part to portray her as a jilted ex who singlehandedly tanked his empire. The extent to which this strategy has been endorsed by his legal team, versus being a scheme Bankman-Fried came up with on his own, is not quite clear.</p><p>By all accounts Ellison appears to have been a prolific notetaker, at one time compiling a list of &#8220;Things Sam is Freaking Out About&#8221; [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/136280673/sam-bankman-fried">I37</a></em>]. This is an incredibly undesirable trait if you happen to be someone engaging in massive fraud, but I&#8217;d imagine the prosecutors who have secured her cooperation in the investigation are just over the moon about it. Prosecutors also have a recording of her speaking to Alameda employees at an all-hands meeting held as the FTX group of companies was falling apart, in which she replied to an employee who asked &#8220;Who made the decision on using customer deposits [to cover Alameda Research&#8217;s shortfalls]?&#8221; with &#8220;Um&#8230; Sam, I guess.&#8220;</p><h4>Gary Wang</h4><p>Gary Wang co-founded both Alameda Research and FTX with Bankman-Fried, and held the Chief Technology Officer title at FTX. Wang, 30, was roommates with Sam Bankman-Fried at MIT. A lot less is known about Wang than about other executives, and he kept a much lower profile. However, he played an instrumental role in starting and operating FTX, and was knowledgeable about the technical implementation of the FTX software.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif" width="486" height="364.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:792,&quot;width&quot;:1056,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:486,&quot;bytes&quot;:39916,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/avif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83990891-886d-48f9-8d2e-805984d16988.avif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Gary Wang (via <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/22/who-is-gary-wang-the-mysterious-co-founder-of-ftx-and-alameda-research/">CoinDesk</a></em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lawyers for the FTX estate and for the SEC<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a> and CFTC<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" target="_self">8</a> have both claimed it was Gary Wang who, at Bankman-Fried&#8217;s direction, coded the secret &#8220;backdoor&#8221; that allowed Alameda Research to borrow billions in FTX customer funds.

He&#8217;s pleaded guilty to two charges: operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and a campaign finance law violation.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg" width="398" height="265.42445054945057" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:398,&quot;bytes&quot;:255547,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa736278d-95df-425b-aff5-a1a136430c91_2000x1334.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Ryan Salame (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/how-ryan-salame-s-neighbors-in-lenox-got-tangled-up-in-ftx-s-fallout">Bloomberg</a></em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Like Singh, Salame served as a straw donor for Bankman-Fried. While Bankman-Fried and Singh mostly donated to Democratic causes, Salame was in charge of funneling FTX money to Republican candidates in furtherance of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s hopes to, as Salame put it, &#8220;weed out anti crypto dems for pro crypto dems and anti crypto repubs for pro crypto repubs&#8221;.</p><h4>Others</h4><p>The prosecution has indicated they intend to bring customers and investors in FTX as witnesses. One customer they&#8217;re hoping to present is a young Ukrainian man who lost "a substantial portion of his life savings" that he had put into FTX after the Russian invasion in 2022. Prosecutors have asked for permission for him to testify via video link, since travel is not likely to be possible due to the ongoing war;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10" target="_self">10</a> the defense has opposed this request.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-11" href="#footnote-11" target="_self">11</a> The prosecutors are clearly looking for sympathetic victims to tug at the heartstrings of the jury, and this certainly sounds like one such individual.</p><p>The prosecution also intends to call FTX employees who will be testifying under grants of immunity, which should be interesting. As of yet, there&#8217;s been no indication of who these people will be, but my list of conspicuously missing executives [<em><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137154544/ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried">I39</a></em>] might be a good place to start speculating.</p><h3>The strategy</h3><h4>Prosecution</h4><p>There&#8217;s no question that billions of dollars of customer funds went missing from FTX. Instead, prosecutors are tasked with convincing a jury that they&#8217;re missing thanks to intentional fraud by Sam Bankman-Fried. The &#8220;intentional&#8221; part is the sticky bit, with prosecutors needing to convince all twelve jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Bankman-Fried <em>intended</em> to defraud people. If even one juror holds out, Bankman-Fried could dodge a guilty verdict thanks to a hung jury &#8212; and trying to appeal to just one sympathetic juror may be his only hope in what looks like a pretty overwhelming case against him.</p><p>However, the government has access to some of the most key players in the FTX empire, and they&#8217;ve agreed to fully cooperate in hopes of lighter sentences for their own roles in the fraud. Other key participants could still be coming, depending on who the prosecution produces under promise of immunity.</p><p>The prosecution also have practically unlimited access to FTX&#8217;s internal records, thanks to the cooperative replacement executive team helming FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy, who also want to see Bankman-Fried found guilty in hopes of aiding the bankruptcy efforts.</p><p>Finally, Bankman-Fried himself has helped prosecutors by embarking on a whirlwind media tour that began during FTX&#8217;s collapse and continued for months afterwards. He spoke to not only journalists, but seemingly to anyone who would listen, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy">venting in Twitter DMs to a journalist</a>, writing <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/annotations/sbf-ftx-pre-mortem-overview/">lengthy blog posts</a>, posting on social media, speaking unguardedly in several hours-long livestreamed Twitter Spaces, and sending private documents to journalists and crypto influencers. Prosecutors can use any of these recorded statements to impeach his testimony during the trial, and will be sure to highlight any inconsistencies between the two.</p><h4>Defense</h4><p>Bankman-Fried will be arguing that FTX&#8217;s collapse was thanks to forces outside of his control, and that he didn&#8217;t <em>knowingly</em> commit any crimes. Crypto markets are notoriously volatile, he&#8217;ll probably say, and we&#8217;ve seen unexpected market movements wipe out poorly-run companies before.</p><p>He may try to blame the whole thing on a &#8220;bank run&#8221;,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12" href="#footnote-12" target="_self">12</a> and say that the company would have been fine if it wasn&#8217;t for the rush of customers all trying to withdraw at once. This is an argument being echoed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis">Michael Lewis</a>, who made the jaw-dropping claim on <em>60 Minutes</em> while promoting his new SBF biography (or perhaps hagiography?<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13" href="#footnote-13" target="_self">13</a>) that &#8220;if there hadn&#8217;t been a run on customer deposits, they&#8217;d still be sitting there making tons of money.&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-14" href="#footnote-14" target="_self">14</a></p><p>Bankman-Fried will also repeat the arguments that he&#8217;s been making since November: that he really &#8220;fucked up&#8221;, but was acting in good faith, mistakenly believing up until the end that FTX was solvent due to poor accounting and incompetent oversight. <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-fried-is-not-a-child">That he&#8217;s just a naive, smol boy who got in over his head.</a> He&#8217;s repeatedly claimed that he was somehow unaware of the multi-billion-dollar hole in FTX&#8217;s balance sheet &#8212; claims also now helpfully being bolstered by Michael Lewis, who says Bankman-Fried told him that the missing funds seemed to him like &#8220;a rounding error&#8230; it felt like we had infinity dollars in there.&#8221;</p><p>Bankman-Fried will also likely repeat his past claims that he was ignorant to what was happening at Alameda and not closely involved with that side of the business, despite apparent contradictory evidence showing that he was in fact deeply involved and often directing Ellison&#8217;s actions.</p><p>His team has also gestured at an argument that Bankman-Fried was acting on advice of counsel, and thus did not have fraudulent intent. However, they&#8217;ve stopped short of bringing a formal advice-of-counsel defense, which would require them to show that Bankman-Fried gave his lawyers a full understanding of what he intended to do, then dutifully followed their advice in doing it. This is typically a tricky defense to pull off, and his team may have decided against pursuing it due to concerns that those lawyers could respond by sharing documents that further implicate him. However, the defense still may try to make allusions to bad legal advice to try to introduce doubt around Bankman-Fried&#8217;s intent. The judge has barred his team from mentioning any reliance on attorneys in opening statements, but decided that he may still allow them to refer to attorney advice on a limited basis, agreeing that it could be useful information for a jury towards determining his intent.</p><p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s team will also attempt to discredit the cooperating witnesses brought by the government, and potentially even say that if someone helmed a fraudulent scheme at FTX, it was <em>them</em>, not Bankman-Fried. They may point to Ellison&#8217;s own writings, where she admitted she felt unqualified to run Alameda Research. It&#8217;s likely that they will argue that those who&#8217;ve agreed to plea deals are simply regurgitating what they think the prosecutors want them to say in hopes of reducing their own punishment. This, however, may be challenging with contemporaneous evidence of those same witnesses blaming Bankman-Fried for FTX&#8217;s fall even before criminal charges were brought, such as in the recording of the all-hands meeting.</p><p>The defense team has also requested permission to cross-examine witnesses on topics including their recreational drug use, a strategy that will almost certainly be aimed at Ellison (among others). However, the judge has ruled that the defense will need to provide advance notice of this line of questioning.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png" width="436" height="218" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:372,&quot;width&quot;:744,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:436,&quot;bytes&quot;:71131,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Caroline @carolinecapital nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human experience is 7:41 AM &#183; Apr 5, 2021&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Caroline @carolinecapital nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human experience is 7:41 AM &#183; Apr 5, 2021" title="Caroline @carolinecapital nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human experience is 7:41 AM &#183; Apr 5, 2021" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5955431f-996d-442e-8599-e64227ed003a_744x372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">(<a href="https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1379036346300305408">Tweet</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>The defense will have to tread a careful line between discrediting potentially damning witness testimony and alienating a jury, who could interpret this strategy as an attempt to make underlings take the fall for Bankman-Fried&#8217;s actions.

We have some preview of how this will go, as both the prosecution and defense have had to submit for approval the questions they intend to ask prospective jurors to evaluate their suitability, although some last-minute requests by the defense for reconsideration are still unresolved.</p><p>Some of the questions will be very standard, asking prospective jurors if they have any anticipated scheduling conflicts, medical or other issues that could interfere with their ability to participate, and so on. Others are much more specific, asking about jurors&#8217; past involvement with and knowledge of cryptocurrencies, startup companies, or FTX itself.</p><p>After that, each side will present opening statements, and the trial will begin in earnest.

They&#8217;re concerned that MDC&#8217;s limited visiting hours will prevent him from meeting with his attorneys after each day of trial to review the day&#8217;s events and prepare for the next day, and so have suggested he be allowed to spend the duration of trial either in the courtroom, with his attorneys, or under the supervision of a <s>babysitter</s> security guard in a temporary residence in New York City. They&#8217;ve also suggested a few other conditions, including a gag order that would prevent SBF from speaking to anyone besides his attorneys, parents, and brother. They threaten that they might use the judge&#8217;s refusal of such a request as basis for an appeal.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> The trial starts next week.</p><p>Meanwhile, all seven expert witnesses proposed by SBF and his team have been rejected by Judge Kaplan after objections from the justice department. Some could still appear at trial if they provide proper disclosures, which were lacking in the original applications. However, others have been denied outright. One, who intended to argue that FTX was innovative and successful, and that its "operational problems were, in fact, predictable" and "quite common to providers offering new financial products", was denied particularly harshly, with Judge Kaplan writing that &#8220;The Court harbors serious doubts regarding [his] qualifications as an expert in the subject matter of his proffered testimony,&#8221; though adding that that was not why he was disqualified. The government&#8217;s one proposed expert witness, an accounting professor, will be allowed.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a></p><h2>In bankruptcies</h2><h3>FTX</h3><p>SBF&#8217;s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, have denied the <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/137154544/ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried">allegations</a> of unjust enrichment that have been leveled against them by the FTX bankruptcy estate. &#8220;This is a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child&#8217;s trial begins,&#8220; said their lawyers, who issued a joint statement describing the allegations as &#8220;completely false&#8221; and echoing some of SBF&#8217;s claims that all this pesky litigation is just a waste of the bankrupt estate&#8217;s funds.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> A (rather sympathetic) <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-family-bubble">article</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230925233939/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-family-bubble">archive</a>) published in the <em>New Yorker</em> mentions that Bankman and Fried earlier this year hired a &#8220;high-powered P.R. consultant&#8221; to help them spread the narrative that the press has unfairly assumed SBF to be guilty, and has not put enough scrutiny into the government&#8217;s case against him, or FTX&#8217;s lawyers&#8217; alleged role in FTX&#8217;s collapse. <em>New York Magazine</em> had previously <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/risa-heller-communications-profile.html">described</a> Risa Heller, said consultant, as &#8220;the crisis-communications warrior of choice for the city&#8217;s most cancellable elites&#8220;, and outlined her role in helping patch up the public reputations of men accused of sexual misconduct including Anthony Weiner, Mario Batali, Arcade Fire singer Win Butler, and Jeffrey Toobin. Given the rather friendly tone of the <em>New Yorker</em> piece, she seems to be earning her salary from the Bankman-Fried family too.</p><p>Meanwhile, Stanford University has opted to return the more than $5.5 million donated by FTX and the Bankman-Fried family, which they say all went towards &#8220;pandemic-related prevention and research&#8221;.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a></p><p>SBF&#8217;s parents aren&#8217;t the only ones being pursued by the FTX estate. On September 21, the company also filed a lawsuit against several former employees of an FTX company based in Hong Kong, hoping to recover $157.3 million.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a> The company alleges that these employees used their connections to other FTX employees to prioritize withdrawing their assets, and those belonging to their families, from the exchange ahead of other customers as it collapsed.</p><h3>Celsius</h3><p>Celsius creditors have overwhelmingly supported a recovery plan that would see them recover 67&#8211;85% of their assets, if approved. The plan involves reorganizing the company into an entity that will stake Ethereum, mine Bitcoin, and perform various other crypto services. Creditors will receive stake in this company. The plan still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court before it can move forward.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" target="_self">8</a></p><p>One additional hurdle will be that the SEC has objected to Coinbase&#8217;s proposed role in the bankruptcy.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9" href="#footnote-9" target="_self">9</a> Celsius has suggested using Coinbase to handle returning crypto assets to customers, but the SEC asserts that they have not been given access to a sealed agreement between the companies. According to the SEC, the proposal goes &#8220;far beyond the services of a distribution agent, contemplating brokerage services and master trading services&#8221;.</p><p>TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington had been on the board of &#8220;NewCo&#8221;, the placeholder name for the company that will be formed if the reorganization plan goes through. However, he left the board on September 24 with a cryptic tweet, writing that &#8220;I am not able to go into much detail on why I requested this change, but that information will come out in due time. This statement was heavily edited by attorneys. I disagree with some of the decisions made around board constitution and, in particular, the board observers.&#8220; He was replaced by Ravi Kaza, an investor and advisor in his Arrington Capital business.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10" target="_self">10</a></p><h2>In other crypto news</h2><h3>JPEX collapse</h3><p>Hong Kong police are now describing the collapse of the JPEX exchange as an apparent fraud involving more than $190 million in possible losses (and counting) [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=jpex-collapse">W3IGG</a></em>].

The group wrote on Twitter that $200 million had been stolen after &#8220;the database of Mixin Network's cloud service provider was attacked by hackers&#8221;. This led to a lot of questions from community members, who questioned how or why a supposedly decentralized network had a single cloud service database that was apparently vulnerable to attack. It seems likely that Mixin was storing private keys on a cloud server, which was then compromised and used to transfer the assets.</p><p>This $200 million theft is the largest this year so far, just squeaking by the $197 million Euler Finance theft in March (though the Euler funds were ultimately returned). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F160fc646-1fbf-4c05-a8bc-d69891add323_974x832.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F160fc646-1fbf-4c05-a8bc-d69891add323_974x832.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F160fc646-1fbf-4c05-a8bc-d69891add323_974x832.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F160fc646-1fbf-4c05-a8bc-d69891add323_974x832.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F160fc646-1fbf-4c05-a8bc-d69891add323_974x832.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F160fc646-1fbf-4c05-a8bc-d69891add323_974x832.jpeg" width="974" height="832" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/160fc646-1fbf-4c05-a8bc-d69891add323_974x832.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:832,&quot;width&quot;:974,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:105986,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Simpsons \&quot;worst day of my life\&quot; meme.

They also make no mention of the variation in minting strategies, including &#8220;lazy minting&#8221; approaches intended to minimize or completely prevent transactions for NFTs that are never ultimately purchased, that would introduce error into this estimate.</p><p>The flaws in dappGambl&#8217;s post don&#8217;t end here, but I think I&#8217;ve made my point that this &#8220;study&#8221; is a pile of garbage.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199a8b60-53fe-409b-b3c9-66e153688e4f_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Now, I am already the kind of person who gets annoyed when media outlets reprint bunk studies, even when they are supporting conclusions that are themselves at least vaguely accurate.

                <![CDATA[<p>Thanks for bearing with me as I was delayed in putting together this recap! I&#8217;ll be back on my usual cadence after this, which should hopefully make for slightly shorter recaps than this one.</p><p>As I go into in more detail below, we are approaching Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s criminal trial. As some have started to ask me: no, I will not be attending the trial in person to report on it. Even putting aside the question of whether I could obtain a press pass, I&#8217;m not based in Manhattan, and don&#8217;t have the flexibility, funding, or any particular desire to relocate there for upwards of a month. I&#8217;ll continue to write about it and all the other crypto happenings from my perch up north, and am confident that the many capable journalists who will be attending in person will do an excellent job of keeping everyone apprised of the day-to-day courtroom goings on. I will undoubtedly source their work heavily.</p><p>Anyway, back to the present! I&#8217;m grouping news by company this week, since so many of these companies have news from across the spectrum of bankruptcy court, civil or criminal court, or other matters.</p><h2>FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried</h2><p>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s day in court looms, and both the prosecutorial and defense teams are busy hammering out specifics as to what evidence will be allowed or excluded, who can be called as expert witnesses, and what questions will be posed to potential jurors during the selection process. As of the latest scheduling update, jury selection will begin a mere two weeks from now on October&nbsp;3.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>The DOJ doesn&#8217;t like some of the questions the defense team is hoping to ask prospective jurors during the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire">voir dire</a></em> process, which include sweeping questions like &#8220;Do you have a negative opinion about cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency markets, cryptocurrency businesses, or people who work in cryptocurrency?&#8221;, and a host of questions about effective altruism.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> The government has described some of the questions as &#8220;unnecessarily intrusive &#8230; and beyond the purpose of <em>voir dire</em>&#8221;. They&#8217;ve objected to questions about effective altruism, scolding that &#8220;<em>voir dire</em> is not the appropriate forum to suggest to the jury that the defendant was simply a good guy who wanted to make the world a better place&#8221;. They&#8217;re also not pleased with draft questions about SBF&#8217;s ADHD. The proposal of those questions seems to me to suggest that SBF&#8217;s team is worried that his behavior and body language &#8212; fidgety even under <em>good</em> circumstances &#8212; might lead jurors to believe he&#8217;s being evasive. However, for the first time that I&#8217;m aware of, the government has suggested they are doubtful of his ADHD diagnosis, writing that &#8220;Thus far, the defense has submitted only a letter from a psychiatrist &#8230; who was employed by the defendant as &#8216;FTX&#8217;s in-house coach,&#8217; and whom other witnesses have described as liberally dispensing prescriptions to FTX employees, including for Adderall.&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This is a reader-supported publication.

Judge Kaplan denied the latest request on September&nbsp;12, saying his team can try again if they want to pose a &#8220;more factually grounded and persuasive showing&#8221;, which I believe is judgespeak for &#8220;stop wasting my time with your bullshit&#8221;. SBF&#8217;s team&#8217;s latest request didn&#8217;t mention any further <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-frieds-jail-conditions">issues with access to adequate food or medication</a>, which makes me hope that those problems have been rectified. As for the computer access, the judge believes the negotiated access to a computer and an Internet connection should be sufficient, particularly given that SBF has already had over seven months to review discovery documents while out on house arrest, and has a very capable legal team to review documents on his behalf.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> I covered Judge Kaplan&#8217;s memo in a little more detail in a <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1701702300858028527">Twitter thread</a>.</p><p>More leaked documents have made their way from SBF to the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-twitter-thread.html">New York Times</a></em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230918082635/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-twitter-thread.html">archive</a>),<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> this time in the form of an unpublished draft apparently meant for Twitter that would have spanned hundreds of tweets if published. SBF shared this document and others with influencer, journalist, and confidant Tiffany Fong in late January&nbsp;2022, and she later sent it to the <em>Times</em>. In the draft, he denigrates Caroline Ellison as unprepared to run Alameda Research and at fault for what he describes as a lack of &#8220;risk management&#8221; (as though the &#8220;risk&#8221; of stealing billions of dollars in customer funds simply needed to be &#8220;managed&#8221; better, rather than avoided entirely). This leak appears similarly motivated as <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-34-the-issue-is-you-got-hacked#%C2%A7sam-bankman-fried">the last</a>: to cast Ellison in the eyes of the public as at fault for FTX&#8217;s downfall.</p><p>Ryan Salame (&#8220;Salem&#8221;, not &#8220;salami&#8221;) has finally left my dwindling &#8220;execs conspicuously missing from FTX criminal proceedings&#8221; list now that an indictment has been unsealed and a plea deal reached [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=ryan-salame-plea">W3IGG</a></em>].<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a> He&#8217;s agreed to forfeit $1.5&nbsp;billion, although it seems at least at this point that he will only actually cough up a small percentage of that in the form of a $6&nbsp;million payment and the forfeiture of two Massachusetts properties, a 2021&nbsp;Porsche&nbsp;911, and equity in a side business.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a> Unlike the other three FTX executives who have reached plea deals, Salame won&#8217;t be cooperating with the investigation.

Binance</em> case. From what we can see, the SEC believes that Binance has been deliberately uncooperative with the discovery process, and Binance believes the SEC is being too aggressive and too broad in its discovery demands. According to the SEC, as of September&nbsp;14, Binance has produced &#8220;a little over 220&nbsp;documents. Many are unintelligible screenshots of bank account information, documents without dates or signatures, and letters from counsel and tables that appear to be prepared for purposes of this litigation, without any supporting evidence or verification by an individual with knowledge confirming the accuracy of the information.&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13" href="#footnote-13" target="_self">13</a></p><p>The SEC is also very concerned with Binance&#8217;s ongoing caginess around who actually holds the assets belonging to US customers, and whether the assets are all there. Recently, they&#8217;ve raised concerns about a company called &#8220;Ceffu&#8221;,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-14" href="#footnote-14" target="_self">14</a> which apparently has control over US customer assets and is affiliated with Binance&#8217;s international business. Although Ceffu insisted in a statement to <em>CoinDesk</em> that it is &#8220;independent and separate&#8221; from Binance and always has been, that doesn&#8217;t actually appear to be the case based on public documents showing that it was a part of the Binance Group,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-15" href="#footnote-15" target="_self">15</a> and the SEC&#8217;s repeated references to Ceffu as a &#8220;Binance affiliate&#8221; and &#8220;Binance Entity&#8221;. This is all par for the course with Binance, who at one point claimed that their entire US arm was an independent &#8220;partner&#8221; of the global company, but such lies are usually reserved for the public and not put in writing in court.</p><p>The SEC&#8217;s frustration is really coming through in some of these documents. In a reply to Binance&#8217;s objection to the SEC&#8217;s motion to compel, the SEC wrote that the filing &#8220;illustrates the house of mirrors the SEC has been navigating for months.&#8220;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-16" href="#footnote-16" target="_self">16</a></p><p>The SEC and Binance faced off at a September&nbsp;18 hearing in which federal Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui declined &#8212; at least at this point &#8212; to order Binance to give the SEC access to their software and infrastructure in order to perform an inspection, which Judge Faruqui agreed with Binance was too extreme a request.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-17" href="#footnote-17" target="_self">17</a> He also didn&#8217;t grant the SEC&#8217;s motion to compel discovery documents or testimony, stating &#8220;Let&#8217;s continue to try to work this out&#8230; I just want to keep things moving.&#8221; However, he did agree with the SEC that the court &#8220;need[s] more than we&#8217;ve got right now&#8221;, and commented that he was not &#8220;super confident that [Binance US] has total control of their assets&#8221;. The SEC and Binance will produce a joint report on October&nbsp;10, and appear at a hearing two days after that.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-18" href="#footnote-18" target="_self">18</a></p><p>Something that probably also ought to concern the SEC as they continue to work to determine the status of US customer funds: blockchain research firm ChainArgos has observed what sure looks like Binance US transferring millions of dollars in tokens to Binance global and a non-US market maker operated by Binance global CEO Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, right around and after the temporary restraining order was granted to try to prevent Binance from transferring US assets to entities outside of the country.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-19" href="#footnote-19" target="_self">19</a></p><p>People more observant than I am<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-20" href="#footnote-20" target="_self">20</a> have also just noticed a mention buried in June court exhibits of a $250&nbsp;million loan issued in December&nbsp;2022 from Binance US to Zhao.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-21" href="#footnote-21" target="_self">21</a> After hearing of all the many millions of dollars in &#8220;loans&#8221; of customer funds to FTX executives, this doesn&#8217;t sit well.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQTPp06i7hjZQqwA-9ZlBuuTdAFAgPQJcOdDZJFehaASq-R0Awom1w9CLIoLcTmopFWCLC2Tg2V-BkP/pubhtml">list of departing Binance executives</a> grows longer still, notably now including the CEO of Binance US, Brian Shroder [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=binanceus-ceo-leaves">W3IGG</a></em>]. Zhao shrugged off the chatter about Shroder&#8217;s departure as mere &#8220;<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#fud">FUD</a>&#8221;, as he likes to do. Zhao wrote on Twitter that Shroder was simply &#8220;taking a deserved break&#8221;, as though it is eminently normal for a CEO to leave a company so abruptly that legal documents filed by Binance US on the day of Shroder&#8217;s departure still referred to him as CEO. Those documents were a part of Binance&#8217;s ongoing attempt to argue that a judge should not allow the SEC to depose Shroder, partly because taking him away from his executive duties would be disruptive to Binance&#8217;s business. So much for that argument, I guess.</p><p>Also departing Binance&#8217;s US arm are its Head of Legal and its Chief Risk Officer, two of perhaps the most ominous-sounding titles that can possibly jump ship when a company is facing two massive lawsuits from regulators.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-22" href="#footnote-22" target="_self">22</a> Meanwhile, Binance global lost its Head of Product,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-23" href="#footnote-23" target="_self">23</a> Head of Eastern Europe and Russia, and General Manager for Russia and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States">CIS</a>.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-24" href="#footnote-24" target="_self">24</a> Other lower-level employees will be leaving the company less-than-voluntarily, as Binance US announced layoffs for 1/3 of its employees, or around 100&nbsp;people [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=binanceus-ceo-leaves">W3IGG</a></em>]. This follows a slew of layoffs in June, shortly after the SEC lawsuit, when Binance US cut 50 roles [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=binance-us-cuts-staff-following-sec-lawsuit">W3IGG</a></em>].</p><h2>Genesis and DCG</h2><p>After announcing that they would be closing down U.S. spot trading &#8220;voluntarily&#8230; and for business reasons&#8221; on September&nbsp;5 [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=genesis-to-close-us-spot-trading-business">W3IGG</a></em>], Genesis announced less than two weeks later that they would be closing down all trading, again &#8220;voluntarily and for business reasons&#8221; [<em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=genesis-closes-trading-entirely">W3IGG</a></em>]. That is one of those intended-to-be-reassuring sentences that gets a whole lot less reassuring the more often they have to repeat it, and the rapidfire closures rather than a more graceful singular announcement certainly feel more like the hallmarks of an <em>in</em>voluntary decision.</p><p>Genesis Global Capital is undergoing bankruptcy at the moment, and on September 6 filed two lawsuits against its own parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), demanding they repay more than $600&nbsp;million in overdue loans. Genesis is in the middle of sorting out a possible agreement with DCG regarding these and other loans, as I mentioned <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/i/136620313/other-bankruptcies">last issue</a>. DCG says the deal would result in a &#8220;70&#8211;90% recovery&#8221; for Genesis creditors, and a &#8220;95&#8211;110% recovery&#8221; for Gemini Earn customers, whose funds are also stuck with Genesis. As I mentioned last time, some Genesis creditors think the deal sounds fishy. Now Gemini&#8217;s Winklevoss twins are saying the same in a characteristically fiery court statement: &#8220;DCG continues its campaign of contrived, misleading, and inaccurate assertions in an attempt to gaslight creditors of the Genesis estate&#8230; Make no mistake: Gemini Lenders will not actually receive anything close in real value terms to the proposed recovery rates under the current &#8216;agreement in principle.&#8217;&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-25" href="#footnote-25" target="_self">25</a></p><h2>Celsius</h2><p>Former Celsius Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon has pleaded guilty to four charges in the criminal case related to the Celsius collapse.
